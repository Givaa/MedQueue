00:00:02,330  -->  00:00:03,570
<v Maximilian>At this point,</v>
2

2

00:00:03,570  -->  00:00:06,620
we learned about data binding with interpolation
3

3

00:00:06,620  -->  00:00:09,210
and v-bind, about event binding
4

4

00:00:09,210  -->  00:00:13,010
and Vue's reactivity, especially also with features
5

5

00:00:13,010  -->  00:00:15,690
like compute properties or Watchers.
6

6

00:00:15,690  -->  00:00:18,170
And these are all core features,
7

7

00:00:18,170  -->  00:00:19,400
which you gotta know.
8

8

00:00:19,400  -->  00:00:23,370
I guess that's why they are in this basics section.
9

9

00:00:23,370  -->  00:00:26,130
There's one more basic building block
10

10

00:00:26,130  -->  00:00:28,630
into which I wanna dive together with you.
11

11

00:00:28,630  -->  00:00:33,630
And that is styling to be precise, dynamic styling.
12

12

00:00:33,670  -->  00:00:36,840
And I prepared a basic example for that,
13

13

00:00:36,840  -->  00:00:40,320
which you'll of course find attached to this lecture.
14

14

00:00:40,320  -->  00:00:44,160
With dynamic styling, I mean that in Vue,
15

15

00:00:44,160  -->  00:00:48,810
we can change the style of things on the page.
16

16

00:00:48,810  -->  00:00:53,050
Well, dynamically in reaction to something, for example,
17

17

00:00:53,050  -->  00:00:56,093
in reaction to a click or to the user entering something.
18

18

00:00:57,320  -->  00:00:59,770
Let me show you an example here.
19

19

00:00:59,770  -->  00:01:04,770
Let's first of all, create a new app with Vue.createApp,
20

20

00:01:04,840  -->  00:01:08,181
passing our object, store it in a constant maybe,
21

21

00:01:08,181  -->  00:01:12,440
and then call mount on our app to mount it
22

22

00:01:12,440  -->  00:01:14,410
to a place in our HTML code.
23

23

00:01:14,410  -->  00:01:16,330
In this case to this section,
24

24

00:01:16,330  -->  00:01:19,993
which has two styling ID with hash styling.
25

25

00:01:20,930  -->  00:01:25,770
And now let's say we want to be able to click on those divs
26

26

00:01:25,770  -->  00:01:29,010
and highlight the div which is active.
27

27

00:01:29,010  -->  00:01:30,950
Now one way of doing that,
28

28

00:01:30,950  -->  00:01:32,650
probably not the shortest way,
29

29

00:01:32,650  -->  00:01:35,810
but definitely a way that should be easy to understand
30

30

00:01:35,810  -->  00:01:39,410
is that we have a data, property here
31

31

00:01:39,410  -->  00:01:42,310
or our data object here in this Vue App.
32

32

00:01:42,310  -->  00:01:44,730
As we did many times before
33

33

00:01:44,730  -->  00:01:49,730
and in here we keep track of which div,
34

34

00:01:49,750  -->  00:01:52,620
which demo div is selected.
35

35

00:01:52,620  -->  00:01:55,490
We could do this with box A selected,
36

36

00:01:55,490  -->  00:01:59,812
which we set to false initially box B selected
37

37

00:01:59,812  -->  00:02:04,270
and then box C selected.
38

38

00:02:04,270  -->  00:02:06,300
So I'm having free data properties
39

39

00:02:06,300  -->  00:02:07,790
with different names,
40

40

00:02:07,790  -->  00:02:11,250
which I will basically mentally connect
41

41

00:02:11,250  -->  00:02:12,430
to those divs.
42

42

00:02:12,430  -->  00:02:14,610
And initially they're all set to false
43

43

00:02:14,610  -->  00:02:17,833
because initially let's say no div is selected.
44

44

00:02:18,820  -->  00:02:21,760
Now let's add a click listener.
45

45

00:02:21,760  -->  00:02:25,020
We can not just add click listeners, to buttons.
46

46

00:02:25,020  -->  00:02:29,189
We can listen to clicks on basically any HTML element
47

47

00:02:29,189  -->  00:02:34,189
and I'll add a method in my methods object therefore,
48

48

00:02:34,610  -->  00:02:37,483
which I wanted to fire when this div is clicked.
49

49

00:02:38,540  -->  00:02:40,073
I'll name it boxSelected.
50

50

00:02:41,110  -->  00:02:44,390
And actually I want to get the box
51

51

00:02:44,390  -->  00:02:48,590
so an identifier for which box was selected as an input.
52

52

00:02:48,590  -->  00:02:50,950
And then here I'll check if box is equal
53

53

00:02:50,950  -->  00:02:53,920
to let's say A, and if that's the case,
54

54

00:02:53,920  -->  00:02:58,920
I'll set this box A selected to true else if
55

55

00:02:59,240  -->  00:03:03,410
box is let's say B I'll set
56

56

00:03:03,410  -->  00:03:07,290
this box B selected to true.
57

57

00:03:07,290  -->  00:03:11,023
And else if box is C,
58

58

00:03:13,990  -->  00:03:18,090
I'll set this box C selected to true.
59

59

00:03:18,090  -->  00:03:20,490
So these are the options we have here.
60

60

00:03:20,490  -->  00:03:23,030
And now on the click listener,
61

61

00:03:23,030  -->  00:03:27,060
I wanna point at box selected or to be precise
62

62

00:03:27,060  -->  00:03:30,960
I'll use this alternative syntax of executing it myself
63

63

00:03:30,960  -->  00:03:35,960
by adding parentheses so that I can pass an A as a string,
64

64

00:03:36,080  -->  00:03:38,520
as a value for this first div.
65

65

00:03:38,520  -->  00:03:41,270
And then repeat this on the other divs
66

66

00:03:41,270  -->  00:03:43,140
so that we have an easy way
67

67

00:03:43,140  -->  00:03:47,800
of using one at the same method for setting different boxes
68

68

00:03:47,800  -->  00:03:48,833
to select it.
69

69

00:03:50,920  -->  00:03:53,540
Currently, by the way, there is no way of unselectig them
70

70

00:03:53,540  -->  00:03:55,483
but for the moment, that's all I need.
71

71

00:03:56,500  -->  00:03:57,710
So now we have ways
72

72

00:03:57,710  -->  00:04:00,830
of changing these data properties through clicks,
73

73

00:04:00,830  -->  00:04:05,090
but I mentioned that I wanna dive into styling with you.
74

74

00:04:05,090  -->  00:04:09,590
Well, let's say wanna highlight when a box is selected,
75

75

00:04:09,590  -->  00:04:11,873
and we can do that with Vue.
76

76

00:04:12,780  -->  00:04:16,210
Let's say we wanna change the border color of a box,
77

77

00:04:16,210  -->  00:04:17,270
if it is selected,
78

78

00:04:17,270  -->  00:04:20,150
solve this first box, for example,
79

79

00:04:20,150  -->  00:04:25,150
well, we can set styles either through CSS and CSS classes,
80

80

00:04:26,060  -->  00:04:30,270
or also with inline styles by using the style attribute,
81

81

00:04:30,270  -->  00:04:34,440
which is a available on basically any HTML element.
82

82

00:04:34,440  -->  00:04:38,460
In there you can do things like this, border color red.
83

83

00:04:38,460  -->  00:04:42,000
If I saved that we have a red color here on the first box,
84

84

00:04:42,000  -->  00:04:44,870
but of course this now always applies
85

85

00:04:44,870  -->  00:04:46,313
not just sometimes.
86

86

00:04:47,200  -->  00:04:50,800
Well, we just need to bind style to a dynamic value
87

87

00:04:50,800  -->  00:04:53,884
and we can do this with, v-bind
88

88

00:04:53,884  -->  00:04:58,330
or the shorthand, just colon style.
89

89

00:04:58,330  -->  00:05:02,630
But now here's a special thing, style and also classes,
90

90

00:05:02,630  -->  00:05:05,960
as you will see in a couple of minutes are different.
91

91

00:05:05,960  -->  00:05:10,240
If you bind those dynamically with v-bind,
92

92

00:05:10,240  -->  00:05:14,650
you can actually use a special syntax supported by Vue
93

93

00:05:14,650  -->  00:05:17,330
for these specific attributes.
94

94

00:05:17,330  -->  00:05:19,600
So for a style and for a class,
95

95

00:05:19,600  -->  00:05:22,730
you can now feed in an object here,
96

96

00:05:22,730  -->  00:05:26,860
which style normally does not want, but you can use it,
97

97

00:05:26,860  -->  00:05:30,300
because that's a special Vue feature for styling class
98

98

00:05:30,300  -->  00:05:33,600
and in there you can have your CSS property name,
99

99

00:05:33,600  -->  00:05:38,600
border color, however, either wrap between single quotes,
100

100

00:05:39,400  -->  00:05:43,030
because we have a JavaScript object here and property names
101

101

00:05:43,030  -->  00:05:45,030
with dashes are not allowed there.
102

102

00:05:45,030  -->  00:05:49,330
So we either need quotes or recommended and better use
103

103

00:05:49,330  -->  00:05:53,640
the camel case version of that where you omit the dash
104

104

00:05:53,640  -->  00:05:55,680
and the character after the dash
105

105

00:05:55,680  -->  00:05:58,830
simply is that capital character now.
106

106

00:05:58,830  -->  00:06:03,150
And then you could set this to red here, for example,
107

107

00:06:03,150  -->  00:06:05,760
or to make it really dynamic
108

108

00:06:05,760  -->  00:06:10,180
check if box A is selected.
109

109

00:06:10,180  -->  00:06:15,180
So if this data property here is true,
110

110

00:06:15,880  -->  00:06:19,570
and use a ternary expression to check if that is truthy.
111

111

00:06:19,570  -->  00:06:20,620
So if it's true,
112

112

00:06:20,620  -->  00:06:23,600
and if that's the case after the question mark,
113

113

00:06:23,600  -->  00:06:25,323
we set this to red.
114

114

00:06:26,250  -->  00:06:30,330
Otherwise we set it to this gray color.
115

115

00:06:30,330  -->  00:06:31,743
So to this hex code.
116

116

00:06:32,660  -->  00:06:36,120
And that's a default ternary expression in JavaScript,
117

117

00:06:36,120  -->  00:06:39,600
which we can use here since we're binding this dynamically.
118

118

00:06:39,600  -->  00:06:43,430
This object syntax is a special feature supported by Vue
119

119

00:06:43,430  -->  00:06:46,980
for the style attributes specifically.
120

120

00:06:46,980  -->  00:06:48,870
If I now saved it and reload,
121

121

00:06:48,870  -->  00:06:52,710
we initially have this gray border color,
122

122

00:06:52,710  -->  00:06:56,780
but if I click on this box, it gets red.
123

123

00:06:56,780  -->  00:06:59,640
Now there's no way of turning it back to gray at the moment,
124

124

00:06:59,640  -->  00:07:03,060
because we have no way of making it unselected,
125

125

00:07:03,060  -->  00:07:04,740
but that's not a problem here
126

126

00:07:04,740  -->  00:07:07,950
because I want to focus on the dynamic styling.
127

127

00:07:07,950  -->  00:07:11,640
And that is how you could set up styles dynamically
128

128

00:07:11,640  -->  00:07:16,640
with Vue, v-bind and this special style binding Syntax.
