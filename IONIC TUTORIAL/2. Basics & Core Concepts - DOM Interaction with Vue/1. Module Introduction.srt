00:00:02,340  -->  00:00:04,540
<v Maximilian>So, now that we get started with</v>
2

2

00:00:04,540  -->  00:00:07,100
Vue JS in the last course module,
3

3

00:00:07,100  -->  00:00:11,770
in this module, we're going to explore Vue's core concepts,
4

4

00:00:11,770  -->  00:00:13,850
the essentials you've got to know
5

5

00:00:13,850  -->  00:00:16,600
when you wanna work with Vue.
6

6

00:00:16,600  -->  00:00:19,350
Specifically in this module, we're going to dive into
7

7

00:00:19,350  -->  00:00:22,530
how exactly Vue interacts with HTML,
8

8

00:00:22,530  -->  00:00:26,460
and how a concept called Templates is related to that.
9

9

00:00:26,460  -->  00:00:28,220
We're going to take another look at
10

10

00:00:28,220  -->  00:00:30,450
outputting dynamic content
11

11

00:00:30,450  -->  00:00:34,390
and explore more options and alternatives there.
12

12

00:00:34,390  -->  00:00:37,430
And we'll also react to user input.
13

13

00:00:37,430  -->  00:00:40,470
I guess we already did this in the first course module,
14

14

00:00:40,470  -->  00:00:43,150
but there's more to it, and in this module,
15

15

00:00:43,150  -->  00:00:45,703
we're going to explore this in depth as well.
