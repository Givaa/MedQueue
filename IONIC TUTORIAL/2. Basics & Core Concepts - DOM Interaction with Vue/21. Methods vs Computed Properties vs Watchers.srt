<v Instructor>I know that there's,</v>

2

00:00:03,120  -->  00:00:06,330
Methods vs Computed vs Watchers thing.
3

3

00:00:06,330  -->  00:00:08,000
Can be very confusing.
4

4

00:00:08,000  -->  00:00:10,240
So it's time for a short summary.
5

5

00:00:10,240  -->  00:00:15,070
Methods can be used in your template to bind data,
6

6

00:00:15,070  -->  00:00:17,800
to use them in a interpolation, for example.
7

7

00:00:17,800  -->  00:00:20,400
To derive data that should be used in the template
8

8

00:00:20,400  -->  00:00:22,120
or for event binding.
9

9

00:00:22,120  -->  00:00:24,290
You can use methods for both.
10

10

00:00:24,290  -->  00:00:27,120
And if you use them in the data binding use case,
11

11

00:00:27,120  -->  00:00:29,820
so if you use them between curly braces, for example,
12

12

00:00:29,820  -->  00:00:33,720
to outsource logic from the template to your view instance,
13

13

00:00:33,720  -->  00:00:35,360
then the method is executed
14

14

00:00:35,360  -->  00:00:38,500
for every re-render cycle of the component.
15

15

00:00:38,500  -->  00:00:40,110
So whenever something changes
16

16

00:00:40,110  -->  00:00:42,020
and the template is re-evaluated,
17

17

00:00:42,020  -->  00:00:44,170
every method that's called in the template
18

18

00:00:44,170  -->  00:00:45,400
will be called again.
19

19

00:00:45,400  -->  00:00:47,800
That's what I showed you a couple of lectures ago.
20

20

00:00:47,800  -->  00:00:48,910
And therefore,
21

21

00:00:48,910  -->  00:00:53,010
you should use methods primarily for event binding.
22

22

00:00:53,010  -->  00:00:54,620
There it's a no brainer.
23

23

00:00:54,620  -->  00:00:55,970
You always use them
24

24

00:00:55,970  -->  00:00:58,200
or for data binding,
25

25

00:00:58,200  -->  00:01:00,840
so with double curly braces, for example,
26

26

00:01:00,840  -->  00:01:03,570
if you really want them to re-execute
27

27

00:01:03,570  -->  00:01:05,961
whenever something changes on the page.
28

28

00:01:05,961  -->  00:01:08,060
Otherwise, you use computed properties
29

29

00:01:08,060  -->  00:01:10,470
because those can only be used with data binding.
30

30

00:01:10,470  -->  00:01:12,700
You don't use them with event binding.
31

31

00:01:12,700  -->  00:01:16,710
And computed properties are great to derive data
32

32

00:01:16,710  -->  00:01:19,920
that's based on other data with the advantage
33

33

00:01:19,920  -->  00:01:24,790
that they will only be re-evaluated and re-executed by view
34

34

00:01:24,790  -->  00:01:27,140
if the dependent data changed.
35

35

00:01:27,140  -->  00:01:30,630
So if the data used inside of the computed property changed,
36

36

00:01:30,630  -->  00:01:34,350
they will not be re-evaluated if some other data changed.
37

37

00:01:34,350  -->  00:01:39,350
And therefore, use them for data that depends on other data.
38

38

00:01:39,860  -->  00:01:40,920
Last but not least,
39

39

00:01:40,920  -->  00:01:44,060
Watchers are not directly used in the template.
40

40

00:01:44,060  -->  00:01:45,870
You don't reference them there,
41

41

00:01:45,870  -->  00:01:48,140
but you can watch any property,
42

42

00:01:48,140  -->  00:01:50,670
even computed properties with them.
43

43

00:01:50,670  -->  00:01:52,630
And that allows you to run code
44

44

00:01:52,630  -->  00:01:54,630
in reaction to some change data.
45

45

00:01:54,630  -->  00:01:57,050
For example, to send the HTTP request,
46

46

00:01:57,050  -->  00:01:59,820
set a timer, stores something in local storage,
47

47

00:01:59,820  -->  00:02:01,070
whatever it is.
48

48

00:02:01,070  -->  00:02:03,780
So typically, you should use Watchers
49

49

00:02:03,780  -->  00:02:06,550
for any non data updates you wanna make.
50

50

00:02:06,550  -->  00:02:09,180
Whatever you got some behind the scenes work to do
51

51

00:02:09,180  -->  00:02:11,040
based on some changing data,
52

52

00:02:11,040  -->  00:02:13,380
you might wanna consider a Watcher.
53

53

00:02:13,380  -->  00:02:15,080
Amongst the free Watchers
54

54

00:02:15,080  -->  00:02:17,820
are probably the feature you'll use the least
55

55

00:02:17,820  -->  00:02:20,860
because you need methods all the time with event binding
56

56

00:02:20,860  -->  00:02:23,540
and computed properties for outputting data
57

57

00:02:23,540  -->  00:02:24,953
that depends on other data.
