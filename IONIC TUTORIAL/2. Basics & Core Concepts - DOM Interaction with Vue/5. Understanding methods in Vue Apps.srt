00:00:02,130  -->  00:00:04,500
<v Instructor>So with interpolation and V-bind,</v>
2

2

00:00:04,500  -->  00:00:08,530
we learned about two key features for outputting,
3

3

00:00:08,530  -->  00:00:13,530
and for a using Vue-managed data in the HTML code.
4

4

00:00:13,810  -->  00:00:15,500
And that is really important.
5

5

00:00:15,500  -->  00:00:20,110
Now let's make our app at least a bit more dynamic.
6

6

00:00:20,110  -->  00:00:21,520
And for data, let's say we actually
7

7

00:00:21,520  -->  00:00:23,440
have two possible courseGoals,
8

8

00:00:23,440  -->  00:00:25,120
which we wanna output here.
9

9

00:00:25,120  -->  00:00:27,930
And for the moment, we'll randomly decide
10

10

00:00:27,930  -->  00:00:29,920
which one to output.
11

11

00:00:29,920  -->  00:00:31,760
Now for that, we need to run some code.
12

12

00:00:31,760  -->  00:00:35,200
We need to basically roll a dice you could say,
13

13

00:00:35,200  -->  00:00:37,440
and then either use this text
14

14

00:00:37,440  -->  00:00:39,040
or another text as a courseGoal.
15

15

00:00:40,227  -->  00:00:42,440
And we can do this with another option.
16

16

00:00:42,440  -->  00:00:45,870
We can set on this Vue app object.
17

17

00:00:45,870  -->  00:00:48,400
We already set the data option.
18

18

00:00:48,400  -->  00:00:51,360
Now it's time to learn about a new option.
19

19

00:00:51,360  -->  00:00:54,390
And that's the methods option.
20

20

00:00:54,390  -->  00:00:57,640
Methods allows you to define functions
21

21

00:00:57,640  -->  00:01:00,770
which should execute when something happens
22

22

00:01:00,770  -->  00:01:04,820
when you call them for example, or as you will learn later,
23

23

00:01:04,820  -->  00:01:08,140
when a user event like a button click occurs.
24

24

00:01:08,140  -->  00:01:11,490
Two methods you pass a JavaScript object.
25

25

00:01:11,490  -->  00:01:13,840
So that's important difference to data.
26

26

00:01:13,840  -->  00:01:17,260
Data itself was a function a method,
27

27

00:01:17,260  -->  00:01:22,260
methods takes an object, which will be full of methods,
28

28

00:01:22,390  -->  00:01:25,000
so of functions, but these functions
29

29

00:01:25,000  -->  00:01:26,100
are now totally up to you.
30

30

00:01:26,100  -->  00:01:28,070
You can name them however you want.
31

31

00:01:28,070  -->  00:01:33,070
For example, outputGoal, but this is totally up to you.
32

32

00:01:33,400  -->  00:01:35,060
This can be any name you want.
33

33

00:01:35,060  -->  00:01:36,640
methods on the other hand,
34

34

00:01:36,640  -->  00:01:41,130
just like data is a reserved term, is a reserved name.
35

35

00:01:41,130  -->  00:01:43,120
But inside of this methods object,
36

36

00:01:43,120  -->  00:01:44,610
you can use whatever you want.
37

37

00:01:44,610  -->  00:01:46,560
The only important thing here is,
38

38

00:01:46,560  -->  00:01:50,990
that all your properties you defined in this methods object
39

39

00:01:50,990  -->  00:01:52,560
needs to be functions
40

40

00:01:52,560  -->  00:01:55,650
because they need to be callable as functions.
41

41

00:01:55,650  -->  00:01:56,950
And you can either do it like this
42

42

00:01:56,950  -->  00:01:59,740
or use the method shorthand in here.
43

43

00:01:59,740  -->  00:02:01,653
Just as we did with data.
44

44

00:02:04,040  -->  00:02:07,730
Now, in outputGoal, we could now calculate
45

45

00:02:07,730  -->  00:02:11,470
a randomNumber with math random,
46

46

00:02:11,470  -->  00:02:14,710
which is a built in function in JavaScript.
47

47

00:02:14,710  -->  00:02:19,170
totally unrelated to Vue, it's a core JavaScript function.
48

48

00:02:19,170  -->  00:02:21,410
And it will simply calculate a randomNumber
49

49

00:02:21,410  -->  00:02:22,813
between zero and one.
50

50

00:02:24,360  -->  00:02:26,660
And here, we could then simply add an if check
51

51

00:02:26,660  -->  00:02:31,390
and say if randomNumber is smaller than zero dot five.
52

52

00:02:31,390  -->  00:02:35,113
We wanna return learn Vue, as a goal.
53

53

00:02:36,010  -->  00:02:40,660
And else, return master Vue whatever you want,
54

54

00:02:40,660  -->  00:02:42,253
those strings are up to you.
55

55

00:02:43,490  -->  00:02:47,750
And now we got this function, this method outputGoal,
56

56

00:02:47,750  -->  00:02:51,330
which will either return this or this text.
57

57

00:02:51,330  -->  00:02:54,800
Now we wanna use this text here in this paragraph
58

58

00:02:54,800  -->  00:02:57,640
to well, display a different text every time
59

59

00:02:57,640  -->  00:02:59,300
this page is reloaded.
60

60

00:02:59,300  -->  00:03:02,120
So for that, we to call this function somehow,
61

61

00:03:02,120  -->  00:03:03,693
so that it executes.
62

62

00:03:05,330  -->  00:03:09,280
And the cool thing is we can call a method,
63

63

00:03:09,280  -->  00:03:12,970
so a function defined in this methods object
64

64

00:03:12,970  -->  00:03:14,740
in our HTML code,
65

65

00:03:14,740  -->  00:03:19,270
just as we can point at a data property, you can do both.
66

66

00:03:19,270  -->  00:03:22,790
So here right now we're pointing at a data property.
67

67

00:03:22,790  -->  00:03:25,180
But we can also instead if we want
68

68

00:03:25,180  -->  00:03:28,920
to execute a function that is defined in methods,
69

69

00:03:28,920  -->  00:03:32,280
that's just important, it needs to be defined and methods.
70

70

00:03:32,280  -->  00:03:35,390
So adding outputGoal here,
71

71

00:03:35,390  -->  00:03:38,820
directly in that config object you pass to create app
72

72

00:03:38,820  -->  00:03:40,913
would not work, for example.
73

73

00:03:41,790  -->  00:03:44,540
But since outputGoal is defined in methods,
74

74

00:03:44,540  -->  00:03:45,830
we can call it here.
75

75

00:03:45,830  -->  00:03:48,490
And since we wanna call it, we need to add parentheses here,
76

76

00:03:48,490  -->  00:03:51,130
just like in regular JavaScript.
77

77

00:03:51,130  -->  00:03:53,390
And that's the interesting part, by the way,
78

78

00:03:53,390  -->  00:03:56,590
in your Vue controlled HTML code
79

79

00:03:56,590  -->  00:03:58,600
in this interpolation syntax,
80

80

00:03:58,600  -->  00:04:01,410
but also when using display binding syntax,
81

81

00:04:01,410  -->  00:04:05,040
you can execute simple JavaScript code.
82

82

00:04:05,040  -->  00:04:07,150
For example, here, we could also execute
83

83

00:04:07,150  -->  00:04:08,853
one plus one if we wanted to.
84

84

00:04:09,710  -->  00:04:14,710
We could also execute math random here, if you want a to.
85

85

00:04:15,550  -->  00:04:18,810
What you can't do in here is write complex code.
86

86

00:04:18,810  -->  00:04:22,070
For example, you can't use if statements in here,
87

87

00:04:22,070  -->  00:04:23,390
this will not work.
88

88

00:04:23,390  -->  00:04:25,590
But you can use ternary expressions,
89

89

00:04:25,590  -->  00:04:28,110
and you can write any JavaScript expression
90

90

00:04:28,110  -->  00:04:31,960
between your double curly braces and when using v-bind.
91

91

00:04:31,960  -->  00:04:33,920
And therefore since we can use
92

92

00:04:33,920  -->  00:04:36,390
such basic JavaScript expressions,
93

93

00:04:36,390  -->  00:04:40,313
we can also call outputGoal here like this.
94

94

00:04:41,810  -->  00:04:43,710
And if I save that and reload,
95

95

00:04:43,710  -->  00:04:45,370
I see learn Vue.
96

96

00:04:45,370  -->  00:04:48,680
If I reload, at some point, I'll see master Vue
97

97

00:04:48,680  -->  00:04:51,480
I'll see a different value from time to time
98

98

00:04:51,480  -->  00:04:54,600
because we always calculate a brand new value
99

99

00:04:54,600  -->  00:04:56,610
because this gets called.
100

100

00:04:56,610  -->  00:04:59,250
And I'm showing this to you because it is important
101

101

00:04:59,250  -->  00:05:01,690
to understand how Vue works
102

102

00:05:01,690  -->  00:05:04,760
that you can execute JavaScript expressions here
103

103

00:05:04,760  -->  00:05:08,030
between the curly braces and when using v-bind.
104

104

00:05:08,030  -->  00:05:10,830
And that this gives you a lot of flexibility.
105

105

00:05:10,830  -->  00:05:14,180
Because just by using this very simple example,
106

106

00:05:14,180  -->  00:05:17,850
our application here is at least a bit more dynamic,
107

107

00:05:17,850  -->  00:05:21,260
because now we don't always see the same text here.
108

108

00:05:21,260  -->  00:05:25,460
Instead, after some reloads, it changes.
109

109

00:05:25,460  -->  00:05:27,710
And that is a more dynamic application,
110

110

00:05:27,710  -->  00:05:30,530
which we can easily build with Vue,
111

111

00:05:30,530  -->  00:05:32,150
and which we couldn't build
112

112

00:05:32,150  -->  00:05:35,620
with just HTML without JavaScript.
113

113

00:05:35,620  -->  00:05:38,780
So with that, we're already getting closer to seeing
114

114

00:05:38,780  -->  00:05:41,190
why Vue is really amazing,
115

115

00:05:41,190  -->  00:05:42,790
and we built our first
116

116

00:05:42,790  -->  00:05:45,603
at least a bit more dynamic application.
