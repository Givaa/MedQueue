00:00:02,100  -->  00:00:05,410
<v ->Now to conclude this introduction to events,</v>
2

2

00:00:05,410  -->  00:00:08,330
which is another core feature, as you can clearly tell,
3

3

00:00:08,330  -->  00:00:09,950
let me show you one other directive
4

4

00:00:09,950  -->  00:00:13,720
which you will very rarely need, but which sometimes
5

5

00:00:13,720  -->  00:00:16,593
in niche scenarios could be helpful.
6

6

00:00:17,670  -->  00:00:21,040
Let's say for whatever reason, here in this app,
7

7

00:00:21,040  -->  00:00:24,960
we want to make sure that when we change the counter here,
8

8

00:00:24,960  -->  00:00:28,711
the output here doesn't change, so that the initial value
9

9

00:00:28,711  -->  00:00:31,660
of the counter is preserved here.
10

10

00:00:31,660  -->  00:00:34,440
Now, you might wonder why we might want to do that.
11

11

00:00:34,440  -->  00:00:37,440
Let's say we have a number of paragraph,
12

12

00:00:37,440  -->  00:00:42,180
where we simply output the starting counter value.
13

13

00:00:42,180  -->  00:00:45,670
And we wanna point at the counter property
14

14

00:00:45,670  -->  00:00:48,160
we're managing in our Vue instance, so that,
15

15

00:00:48,160  -->  00:00:50,460
if we ever change it here,
16

16

00:00:50,460  -->  00:00:53,820
we do reflect that correct starting counter here.
17

17

00:00:53,820  -->  00:00:54,930
But we want to make sure that
18

18

00:00:54,930  -->  00:00:57,680
the starting counter never changes.
19

19

00:00:57,680  -->  00:01:00,670
And right now of course, since we reference counter,
20

20

00:01:00,670  -->  00:01:03,203
it will change whenever we change to counter.
21

21

00:01:04,180  -->  00:01:07,800
If you have such a scenario that you have some data
22

22

00:01:07,800  -->  00:01:11,930
that changes and you want to preserve the initial state
23

23

00:01:11,930  -->  00:01:14,350
and not reflect any other changes,
24

24

00:01:14,350  -->  00:01:17,490
there is a special directive you can put on to the element
25

25

00:01:17,490  -->  00:01:20,760
where you are using that dynamic value in.
26

26

00:01:20,760  -->  00:01:25,760
And that's the V once directive which is built into Vue.
27

27

00:01:25,870  -->  00:01:29,680
This tells Vue that any dynamic data bindings,
28

28

00:01:29,680  -->  00:01:32,653
like this interpolation here on this element,
29

29

00:01:32,653  -->  00:01:35,920
should only be evaluated once.
30

30

00:01:35,920  -->  00:01:39,390
So if data value changes thereafter, here in this place,
31

31

00:01:39,390  -->  00:01:42,510
it will not be reflected it will not be updated.
32

32

00:01:42,510  -->  00:01:45,600
So now if I reload, we see the starting counter 10 here,
33

33

00:01:45,600  -->  00:01:48,600
but if I change the counter, it only changes down there
34

34

00:01:48,600  -->  00:01:51,793
in the second green box and not in the first one.
35

35

00:01:53,680  -->  00:01:57,480
Now again, this is a niche feature, but it is useful
36

36

00:01:57,480  -->  00:02:00,760
to be aware of it if you ever had a scenario like this
37

37

00:02:00,760  -->  00:02:03,450
where you need to lock an initial value in,
38

38

00:02:03,450  -->  00:02:05,957
we once can help you with that.
