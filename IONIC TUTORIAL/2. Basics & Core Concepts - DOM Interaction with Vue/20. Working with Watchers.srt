1

00:00:02,490  -->  00:00:04,740
<v Lecturer>Now we learned about computed properties,</v>
2

2

00:00:04,740  -->  00:00:07,920
a key feature for outputting dynamic values
3

3

00:00:07,920  -->  00:00:10,570
that depend on multiple input values,
4

4

00:00:10,570  -->  00:00:13,800
or like in this case here on one input value
5

5

00:00:13,800  -->  00:00:16,240
and one hard-coded value.
6

6

00:00:16,240  -->  00:00:19,840
They're all this and never reactivity feature
7

7

00:00:19,840  -->  00:00:23,790
built into Vue, and that would be watchers.
8

8

00:00:23,790  -->  00:00:25,860
What are Watchers?
9

9

00:00:25,860  -->  00:00:29,020
Well, a watcher is basically a function
10

10

00:00:29,020  -->  00:00:32,040
you can tell Vue to execute,
11

11

00:00:32,040  -->  00:00:34,750
when one of its dependencies changed.
12

12

00:00:34,750  -->  00:00:37,670
Okay, that sounds just like computed properties,
13

13

00:00:37,670  -->  00:00:39,060
doesn't it?
14

14

00:00:39,060  -->  00:00:41,430
Well, indeed you can use Watchers
15

15

00:00:41,430  -->  00:00:43,730
instead of computed properties
16

16

00:00:43,730  -->  00:00:45,820
and here's how that would work,
17

17

00:00:45,820  -->  00:00:47,973
and why you maybe don't wanna do it.
18

18

00:00:48,900  -->  00:00:53,900
Let me add a full name, data property here like this,
19

19

00:00:54,210  -->  00:00:57,440
and therefore let's comment out this full name,
20

20

00:00:57,440  -->  00:01:00,910
computed property so that we don't have a name clash.
21

21

00:01:00,910  -->  00:01:04,130
You don't wanna use a computed and a data property
22

22

00:01:04,130  -->  00:01:05,213
with the same name.
23

23

00:01:06,120  -->  00:01:08,620
Now we can add a new configuration here,
24

24

00:01:08,620  -->  00:01:12,520
a new option to this object we passed to create app,
25

25

00:01:12,520  -->  00:01:15,850
again anywhere in their, position doesn't matter.
26

26

00:01:15,850  -->  00:01:17,170
I'll add it here,
27

27

00:01:17,170  -->  00:01:22,170
And that's the watch option just like data computed
28

28

00:01:22,430  -->  00:01:24,530
and methods, this name is not up to you
29

29

00:01:24,530  -->  00:01:27,270
it's one of the supported features Vue has,
30

30

00:01:27,270  -->  00:01:29,393
and therefore this has to be watch.
31

31

00:01:30,350  -->  00:01:34,960
Watch wants an object, just like computed and methods.
32

32

00:01:34,960  -->  00:01:36,340
And, and here again,
33

33

00:01:36,340  -->  00:01:39,150
you'll define a bunch of methods.
34

34

00:01:39,150  -->  00:01:44,150
To be precise here, you can now use a name
35

35

00:01:44,550  -->  00:01:47,900
you used in a data or computed property
36

36

00:01:47,900  -->  00:01:51,020
as a name for a watcher method.
37

37

00:01:51,020  -->  00:01:51,853
For example,
38

38

00:01:51,853  -->  00:01:53,450
here we could use name,
39

39

00:01:53,450  -->  00:01:55,750
because we have that name data property
40

40

00:01:55,750  -->  00:01:59,040
and define it as a method here in watch.
41

41

00:01:59,040  -->  00:02:00,220
Technically, this is okay,
42

42

00:02:00,220  -->  00:02:03,020
we'll not have any name clashes here.
43

43

00:02:03,020  -->  00:02:06,320
This tells Vue one important thing.
44

44

00:02:06,320  -->  00:02:11,320
Whenever name changes, this watcher method will re execute
45

45

00:02:13,320  -->  00:02:15,150
and that's really important.
46

46

00:02:15,150  -->  00:02:19,330
This name here being used here sets up this connection.
47

47

00:02:19,330  -->  00:02:20,820
That's how watchers work.
48

48

00:02:20,820  -->  00:02:25,030
You repeat another data or computed property name
49

49

00:02:25,030  -->  00:02:28,000
in a watcher method as a method name there,
50

50

00:02:28,000  -->  00:02:29,323
and when you do that,
51

51

00:02:29,323  -->  00:02:34,000
that watcher method will be executed automatically by Vue,
52

52

00:02:34,000  -->  00:02:37,440
whenever a property of that name,
53

53

00:02:37,440  -->  00:02:41,250
so this case, whenever the name property changes.
54

54

00:02:41,250  -->  00:02:44,110
We could also watch the counter property instead,
55

55

00:02:44,110  -->  00:02:46,730
but here I wanna watch the name.
56

56

00:02:46,730  -->  00:02:50,100
And then in here we can specify any logic we want.
57

57

00:02:50,100  -->  00:02:53,290
We don't return anything because we're not going to use
58

58

00:02:53,290  -->  00:02:58,090
the watcher anywhere in our HTML code to use a return value.
59

59

00:02:58,090  -->  00:03:01,270
Instead in here we run logic that should be executed
60

60

00:03:01,270  -->  00:03:02,740
When the name changed.
61

61

00:03:02,740  -->  00:03:03,573
For example,
62

62

00:03:03,573  -->  00:03:05,947
we could update full name here, and set it,
63

63

00:03:05,947  -->  00:03:10,023
= to this.name + an empty space + Schwartzmuller.
64

64

00:03:12,170  -->  00:03:16,170
Actually, we don't even need to refer to this.name here,
65

65

00:03:16,170  -->  00:03:19,870
a watcher function automatically gets the last value,
66

66

00:03:19,870  -->  00:03:24,530
the latest value of the watch property as an argument.
67

67

00:03:24,530  -->  00:03:26,980
This is passed in automatically by Vue,
68

68

00:03:26,980  -->  00:03:29,930
this latest value of the watch property.
69

69

00:03:29,930  -->  00:03:32,050
Hence, we can accept it as an argument,
70

70

00:03:32,050  -->  00:03:34,943
name it however you want, and then use it in here.
71

71

00:03:35,930  -->  00:03:39,610
We actually also could accept a second argument here,
72

72

00:03:39,610  -->  00:03:43,840
besides the value and that would then be the previous value,
73

73

00:03:43,840  -->  00:03:46,590
the old value of the watch property.
74

74

00:03:46,590  -->  00:03:48,060
Here I'm just accepting one
75

75

00:03:48,060  -->  00:03:49,710
because we only need that one,
76

76

00:03:49,710  -->  00:03:53,060
but you could accept two arguments If you wanted to.
77

77

00:03:53,060  -->  00:03:55,113
New value and old value.
78

78

00:03:56,250  -->  00:03:59,210
And with that we would also update the full name
79

79

00:03:59,210  -->  00:04:01,330
whenever the name changes.
80

80

00:04:01,330  -->  00:04:04,570
If we save that and reload, indeed, if I type here,
81

81

00:04:04,570  -->  00:04:08,300
you have the same behavior as before with one difference
82

82

00:04:08,300  -->  00:04:10,560
we always see Schwartz Muller here,
83

83

00:04:10,560  -->  00:04:15,350
but we could also change this, check if value is empty...
84

84

00:04:15,350  -->  00:04:17,690
It's an empty string and if that's the case,
85

85

00:04:17,690  -->  00:04:20,803
we set full name equal to an empty string as well.
86

86

00:04:20,803  -->  00:04:23,980
That would be how we could ensure that full name is empty.
87

87

00:04:23,980  -->  00:04:27,380
If value is empty, actually of course,
88

88

00:04:27,380  -->  00:04:30,333
I should then put the other code into an else block Vue,
89

89

00:04:31,490  -->  00:04:34,173
and now we have that described behavior.
90

90

00:04:35,660  -->  00:04:37,280
So that's a watcher.
91

91

00:04:37,280  -->  00:04:38,113
And as you see,
92

92

00:04:38,113  -->  00:04:41,523
you could use it as an alternative to a computed property.
93

93

00:04:42,370  -->  00:04:44,110
Now we have a couple of problems
94

94

00:04:44,110  -->  00:04:46,090
if we use it for that though,
95

95

00:04:46,090  -->  00:04:46,923
for one,
96

96

00:04:46,923  -->  00:04:49,790
I would argue that the concept of a computed property
97

97

00:04:49,790  -->  00:04:52,920
is maybe a bit easier to understand,
98

98

00:04:52,920  -->  00:04:57,610
but the bigger problem arises If we have a computer property
99

99

00:04:57,610  -->  00:05:00,710
that would use more than one dependency,
100

100

00:05:00,710  -->  00:05:04,540
let's say we have a second input.
101

101

00:05:04,540  -->  00:05:06,680
I just duplicated my input here,
102

102

00:05:06,680  -->  00:05:09,403
and there we have a last name.
103

103

00:05:10,770  -->  00:05:13,540
Now we add a new data property,
104

104

00:05:13,540  -->  00:05:16,030
last name, which initially is an empty string,
105

105

00:05:16,030  -->  00:05:19,873
and this is bound with the model on that second input.
106

106

00:05:21,410  -->  00:05:23,600
Now we have these two names.
107

107

00:05:23,600  -->  00:05:27,790
Now we wanna update the full name whenever the name,
108

108

00:05:27,790  -->  00:05:29,963
or the last name changed.
109

109

00:05:31,000  -->  00:05:32,770
To achieve this with a watcher,
110

110

00:05:32,770  -->  00:05:36,010
we need to add a second watcher because the first one
111

111

00:05:36,010  -->  00:05:38,103
simply watches the name.
112

112

00:05:39,020  -->  00:05:40,860
Now we need to add a second one
113

113

00:05:40,860  -->  00:05:45,480
where we also watch last name and get the value of that.
114

114

00:05:45,480  -->  00:05:49,300
And in here we have almost the same code,
115

115

00:05:49,300  -->  00:05:51,697
but we wanna set the full name here,
116

116

00:05:51,697  -->  00:05:56,410
= to this.name + blank + lost + value
117

117

00:05:59,180  -->  00:06:02,320
because here we get the latest value of last name
118

118

00:06:02,320  -->  00:06:04,980
and up there in our first watcher,
119

119

00:06:04,980  -->  00:06:09,430
we wanna change this to value + blank + this.last name
120

120

00:06:09,430  -->  00:06:11,650
because we're watching name here.
121

121

00:06:11,650  -->  00:06:16,650
Now we have two watchers to reflect the full name,
122

122

00:06:17,210  -->  00:06:19,623
which is managed with two inputs.
123

123

00:06:20,640  -->  00:06:23,860
And yes, this works, but it's a lot of code,
124

124

00:06:23,860  -->  00:06:27,120
especially if we compare it to the computed property
125

125

00:06:27,120  -->  00:06:28,850
alternative.
126

126

00:06:28,850  -->  00:06:33,303
Let me comment out the full name, data property,
127

127

00:06:35,200  -->  00:06:38,840
and let's also comment out the watchers.
128

128

00:06:38,840  -->  00:06:40,130
We could remove them,
129

129

00:06:40,130  -->  00:06:42,840
but I'll keep them around for reference.
130

130

00:06:42,840  -->  00:06:45,090
And let's bring back the computed property,
131

131

00:06:45,090  -->  00:06:49,130
to see how much easier it is with a computed property.
132

132

00:06:49,130  -->  00:06:52,810
There if we want to use two dependencies,
133

133

00:06:52,810  -->  00:06:56,670
we simply reference two dependencies like this,
134

134

00:06:56,670  -->  00:06:58,503
pointing at this last name.
135

135

00:06:59,590  -->  00:07:03,730
And now we got the desired behavior with less code.
136

136

00:07:03,730  -->  00:07:06,170
Maybe we should also tweak df check here,
137

137

00:07:06,170  -->  00:07:10,190
and check if the name is empty or this last name is empty.
138

138

00:07:10,190  -->  00:07:11,740
If either of the two is empty,
139

139

00:07:11,740  -->  00:07:14,340
we return an empty full name.
140

140

00:07:14,340  -->  00:07:17,923
But with that, we got the desired behavior,
141

141

00:07:19,320  -->  00:07:21,250
and it's really not a lot of code.
142

142

00:07:21,250  -->  00:07:23,840
It's just this code to get a full name,
143

143

00:07:23,840  -->  00:07:28,350
dynamically compared that to our two watchers.
144

144

00:07:28,350  -->  00:07:31,250
Why do we have watchers then if we can use them,
145

145

00:07:31,250  -->  00:07:32,960
but they're worse?
146

146

00:07:32,960  -->  00:07:36,330
Because this works but it's not the main scenario
147

147

00:07:36,330  -->  00:07:37,710
for using watchers.
148

148

00:07:37,710  -->  00:07:39,350
Watchers are powerful,
149

149

00:07:39,350  -->  00:07:43,653
if you have a different kind of intent in mind.
150

150

00:07:45,470  -->  00:07:47,230
Let's come back to our counter here.
151

151

00:07:47,230  -->  00:07:52,190
Let's say when the counter exceeds 50, anything like that,
152

152

00:07:52,190  -->  00:07:54,160
we wanna reset it.
153

153

00:07:54,160  -->  00:07:57,840
That's the type of task where a watcher shines.
154

154

00:07:57,840  -->  00:08:01,040
We wanna change counter when something happens
155

155

00:08:01,040  -->  00:08:05,850
so we can watch counter and get its latest value,
156

156

00:08:05,850  -->  00:08:10,160
to then check if value,
157

157

00:08:10,160  -->  00:08:13,300
so the value of the counter is greater than 50,
158

158

00:08:13,300  -->  00:08:18,273
and if that's the case, we set this.counter = 0.
159

159

00:08:20,780  -->  00:08:24,150
That's the kind of thing where watchers can be helpful.
160

160

00:08:24,150  -->  00:08:25,890
If you wanna run logic,
161

161

00:08:25,890  -->  00:08:29,360
that may be all the updates a data property,
162

162

00:08:29,360  -->  00:08:31,580
but which shouldn't always do that.
163

163

00:08:31,580  -->  00:08:35,080
For example, here, I only want to set the counter to zero,
164

164

00:08:35,080  -->  00:08:36,950
if we exceed 50.
165

165

00:08:36,950  -->  00:08:40,860
A computed property would probably not be the best
166

166

00:08:40,860  -->  00:08:43,390
alternative here for this kind of task.
167

167

00:08:43,390  -->  00:08:45,840
You can try solving this with a computed property
168

168

00:08:45,840  -->  00:08:49,150
and you'll quickly see that you'll face some problems here.
169

169

00:08:49,150  -->  00:08:51,540
With a watcher, this is easy though.
170

170

00:08:51,540  -->  00:08:54,930
If we save that and now reload, we can change the counter,
171

171

00:08:54,930  -->  00:08:57,890
but you'll see if I press add 10 again
172

172

00:08:57,890  -->  00:09:01,350
and hence who would exceed 50 it's back to zero
173

173

00:09:01,350  -->  00:09:03,220
and starts again.
174

174

00:09:03,220  -->  00:09:06,390
That's the kind of task where a watcher can shine.
175

175

00:09:06,390  -->  00:09:09,940
Another example, would be HTTP requests,
176

176

00:09:09,940  -->  00:09:12,550
which you wanna send if certain data changes,
177

177

00:09:12,550  -->  00:09:16,890
or timers which you wanna set, if certain values change.
178

178

00:09:16,890  -->  00:09:20,850
For example, here, we could say if value exceeds 50,
179

179

00:09:20,850  -->  00:09:25,520
I want to set a timer to two seconds,
180

180

00:09:25,520  -->  00:09:30,250
and in the function that executes after the two seconds,
181

181

00:09:30,250  -->  00:09:33,400
I want to reset the counter.
182

182

00:09:33,400  -->  00:09:37,030
Like this, that won't work though, because this in here,
183

183

00:09:37,030  -->  00:09:39,070
won't refer to the same thing,
184

184

00:09:39,070  -->  00:09:42,730
this would refer to outside of this function
185

185

00:09:42,730  -->  00:09:46,980
and therefore we can work around that by storing,
186

186

00:09:46,980  -->  00:09:50,170
this in a number of constant and using that here,
187

187

00:09:50,170  -->  00:09:51,860
that's nothing Vue specific,
188

188

00:09:51,860  -->  00:09:53,840
that's just how JavaScript works,
189

189

00:09:53,840  -->  00:09:56,450
that this key word can be tricky there,
190

190

00:09:56,450  -->  00:09:58,650
but with that code if I reload,
191

191

00:09:58,650  -->  00:10:01,750
if I ramp up the timer, it goes above 50,
192

192

00:10:01,750  -->  00:10:03,890
but it's reset eventually.
193

193

00:10:03,890  -->  00:10:07,830
Because we set a time out every time the counter changes
194

194

00:10:07,830  -->  00:10:09,730
and is greater than 50.
195

195

00:10:09,730  -->  00:10:12,450
That's by the way, all the why it resets multiple times
196

196

00:10:12,450  -->  00:10:15,880
here, because if I exceed 50 and I keep on going,
197

197

00:10:15,880  -->  00:10:18,600
I trigger more and more watcher executions
198

198

00:10:18,600  -->  00:10:21,220
and more and more timers get set.
199

199

00:10:21,220  -->  00:10:24,540
That's the kind of task where a watcher can be useful
200

200

00:10:24,540  -->  00:10:28,090
if you wanna run some code, which may be,
201

201

00:10:28,090  -->  00:10:32,570
but not necessarily also updates some data property
202

202

00:10:32,570  -->  00:10:34,950
in reaction to a property changing.
203

203

00:10:34,950  -->  00:10:37,040
If you wanna do that execute code,
204

204

00:10:37,040  -->  00:10:40,680
because something changed, then watchers can be helpful.
205

205

00:10:40,680  -->  00:10:44,610
If you just want to calculate some output value dynamically,
206

206

00:10:44,610  -->  00:10:46,853
computed properties are your friend.
