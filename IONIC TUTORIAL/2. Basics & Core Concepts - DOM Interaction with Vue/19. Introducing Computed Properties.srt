00:00:02,150  -->  00:00:05,400
<v ->Well, you could of course put your code in here.</v>
2

2

00:00:05,400  -->  00:00:09,260
Name plus Schwartz Muller, for example,
3

3

00:00:09,260  -->  00:00:10,990
you could put it in here.
4

4

00:00:10,990  -->  00:00:14,180
And if you do that, you avoid this problem.
5

5

00:00:14,180  -->  00:00:17,300
Now view is able to see what's getting used here
6

6

00:00:17,300  -->  00:00:19,610
and it will only updated this paragraph
7

7

00:00:19,610  -->  00:00:22,106
and only reevaluated if well,
8

8

00:00:22,106  -->  00:00:24,380
in this case name changed
9

9

00:00:24,380  -->  00:00:26,500
and output full name has never called
10

10

00:00:26,500  -->  00:00:29,091
and therefore will never be called by view.
11

11

00:00:29,091  -->  00:00:33,110
But now we have more logic in our HTML code
12

12

00:00:33,110  -->  00:00:36,320
and that's again, not good as you learned.
13

13

00:00:36,320  -->  00:00:38,630
So there is a third nice feature we can use,
14

14

00:00:38,630  -->  00:00:40,193
computed properties.
15

15

00:00:41,550  -->  00:00:45,240
Computed properties are essentially like methods
16

16

00:00:45,240  -->  00:00:48,610
with one important difference view will be aware
17

17

00:00:48,610  -->  00:00:52,190
of their dependencies and only reexecute them
18

18

00:00:52,190  -->  00:00:54,453
if one of the dependencies changed.
19

19

00:00:55,330  -->  00:00:59,370
Computed is the third big configuration option
20

20

00:00:59,370  -->  00:01:02,640
we learn about for the app we created.
21

21

00:01:02,640  -->  00:01:04,200
The first one was data.
22

22

00:01:04,200  -->  00:01:05,850
The second one was methods.
23

23

00:01:05,850  -->  00:01:07,870
The third one is computed.
24

24

00:01:07,870  -->  00:01:10,560
You can add it anywhere in this conflict object
25

25

00:01:10,560  -->  00:01:13,770
here I will add it between data at methods,
26

26

00:01:13,770  -->  00:01:15,785
but the position doesn't matter.
27

27

00:01:15,785  -->  00:01:20,785
So you add computed here and just like methods and data.
28

28

00:01:20,950  -->  00:01:23,240
This is not a name you can choose.
29

29

00:01:23,240  -->  00:01:24,830
That is a name you have to use
30

30

00:01:24,830  -->  00:01:27,600
because it's one of the key options,
31

31

00:01:27,600  -->  00:01:31,640
supported by view in view apps.
32

32

00:01:31,640  -->  00:01:35,620
Computed like methods wants an object.
33

33

00:01:35,620  -->  00:01:38,745
So you pass an object as a value to compute it.
34

34

00:01:38,745  -->  00:01:41,070
And now in computed,
35

35

00:01:41,070  -->  00:01:45,430
you define a bunch of methods just like in methods,
36

36

00:01:45,430  -->  00:01:48,860
but the methods you defined and computed will be called
37

37

00:01:48,860  -->  00:01:50,760
and executed differently.
38

38

00:01:50,760  -->  00:01:53,989
That's why we have these two different blocks.
39

39

00:01:53,989  -->  00:01:58,000
So here we could add a full name method,
40

40

00:01:58,000  -->  00:02:02,250
and I'm naming it full name and not output full name,
41

41

00:02:02,250  -->  00:02:04,810
even though I could, because that name is up to you,
42

42

00:02:04,810  -->  00:02:08,360
but I'm naming it like this because we're going to use this
43

43

00:02:08,360  -->  00:02:11,480
like a data property, not like a method,
44

44

00:02:11,480  -->  00:02:13,570
even though technically it is a method,
45

45

00:02:13,570  -->  00:02:15,530
but we're not going to use it as such.
46

46

00:02:15,530  -->  00:02:16,990
We're not going to call it.
47

47

00:02:16,990  -->  00:02:20,450
And therefore you should name your computed properties
48

48

00:02:20,450  -->  00:02:23,623
just as you would name your data properties.
49

49

00:02:25,170  -->  00:02:26,630
And now in here,
50

50

00:02:26,630  -->  00:02:30,760
we wanna return to value that eventually should be yielded
51

51

00:02:30,760  -->  00:02:32,630
by that computed property
52

52

00:02:32,630  -->  00:02:35,800
and there I'll just copy the exact same code
53

53

00:02:35,800  -->  00:02:38,700
I had in my output full name method.
54

54

00:02:38,700  -->  00:02:42,360
So I'll copy that code and put that in there.
55

55

00:02:42,360  -->  00:02:45,890
And now, as I mentioned, we can use this full name,
56

56

00:02:45,890  -->  00:02:50,700
computed property in our HTML code like this.
57

57

00:02:50,700  -->  00:02:51,960
And that's important.
58

58

00:02:51,960  -->  00:02:55,460
Not like this without parentheses,
59

59

00:02:55,460  -->  00:02:57,010
you don't call it
60

60

00:02:57,010  -->  00:03:01,350
you just point at it and view we'll call it for you.
61

61

00:03:01,350  -->  00:03:05,010
We use it just like we use data properties
62

62

00:03:05,010  -->  00:03:07,060
like to counter here.
63

63

00:03:07,060  -->  00:03:10,870
And that's why we should also name our computed properties
64

64

00:03:10,870  -->  00:03:12,320
like data properties,
65

65

00:03:12,320  -->  00:03:15,670
because we use them like properties like variables.
66

66

00:03:15,670  -->  00:03:17,593
We don't use them like functions.
67

67

00:03:18,790  -->  00:03:21,300
So full name here will be connected
68

68

00:03:21,300  -->  00:03:23,460
to this full name computed property
69

69

00:03:23,460  -->  00:03:26,020
so the name of course has to be equal.
70

70

00:03:26,020  -->  00:03:28,761
And now view will execute this for you.
71

71

00:03:28,761  -->  00:03:30,380
It will basically check
72

72

00:03:30,380  -->  00:03:32,590
if there is a full name data property.
73

73

00:03:32,590  -->  00:03:34,260
And if there isn't, it will check
74

74

00:03:34,260  -->  00:03:36,940
If there may be as a computed property with the name
75

75

00:03:36,940  -->  00:03:39,410
and if that's the case, it will execute it.
76

76

00:03:39,410  -->  00:03:42,070
And hence, if I saved us here in reload,
77

77

00:03:42,070  -->  00:03:44,100
we see nothing here initially.
78

78

00:03:44,100  -->  00:03:45,980
But as soon as I start typing,
79

79

00:03:45,980  -->  00:03:48,570
we see the full name show up again.
80

80

00:03:48,570  -->  00:03:50,585
So we've got the same behavior as before,
81

81

00:03:50,585  -->  00:03:53,150
but now with one important difference,
82

82

00:03:53,150  -->  00:03:55,253
let's check the developer tools again.
83

83

00:03:56,680  -->  00:03:58,770
In there If I reload,
84

84

00:03:58,770  -->  00:04:03,250
you will notice running again once initially of course,
85

85

00:04:03,250  -->  00:04:07,020
because it needs to evaluate the value returned by full name
86

86

00:04:07,020  -->  00:04:09,923
when the app is first rendered to discreet.
87

87

00:04:10,788  -->  00:04:15,130
But now if I cleared it, if I changed my counter,
88

88

00:04:15,130  -->  00:04:18,450
we don't see running again and keep in mind
89

89

00:04:18,450  -->  00:04:20,450
that with a method, we did see it,
90

90

00:04:20,450  -->  00:04:22,860
but now that's no longer the case.
91

91

00:04:22,860  -->  00:04:25,540
We only see it if we type here,
92

92

00:04:25,540  -->  00:04:28,690
which makes a lot of sense because here we really changed
93

93

00:04:28,690  -->  00:04:31,550
something that's being used in that computed property.
94

94

00:04:31,550  -->  00:04:34,203
We change the name with every keystroke.
95

95

00:04:34,203  -->  00:04:37,030
So with computer properties,
96

96

00:04:37,030  -->  00:04:41,210
view is aware of the dependencies
97

97

00:04:41,210  -->  00:04:42,900
off the computer properties.
98

98

00:04:42,900  -->  00:04:46,460
So in this case, that name is a dependency
99

99

00:04:46,460  -->  00:04:50,760
and it will cache the computed property value
100

100

00:04:50,760  -->  00:04:54,460
and only recalculate and reevaluate it
101

101

00:04:54,460  -->  00:04:56,940
if one of the dependencies in this case,
102

102

00:04:56,940  -->  00:05:01,340
the only dependency we have the name property changed.
103

103

00:05:01,340  -->  00:05:04,410
And that's the key difference for performance.
104

104

00:05:04,410  -->  00:05:08,170
It's better to use computer properties that methods
105

105

00:05:08,170  -->  00:05:11,540
for outputting values In most cases.
106

106

00:05:11,540  -->  00:05:15,820
only use methods if you know that you want to recalculate
107

107

00:05:15,820  -->  00:05:19,460
a value whenever anything on the page changed.
108

108

00:05:19,460  -->  00:05:22,300
In most scenarios, that will not be the case.
109

109

00:05:22,300  -->  00:05:25,659
You only want to recalculate a value
110

110

00:05:25,659  -->  00:05:26,492
if a dependency changed.
111

111

00:05:26,492  -->  00:05:28,680
And that's when computed properties shine.
112

112

00:05:28,680  -->  00:05:32,560
You still need methods either because you have something
113

113

00:05:32,560  -->  00:05:36,040
that you really want to reexecute whenever anything changed
114

114

00:05:36,040  -->  00:05:39,860
or more often, because you have events
115

115

00:05:39,860  -->  00:05:43,450
and you wanna trigger certain methods when an event occurs,
116

116

00:05:43,450  -->  00:05:45,000
that does not change.
117

117

00:05:45,000  -->  00:05:47,490
You still bind your events to methods.
118

118

00:05:47,490  -->  00:05:50,330
You don't bind events to computer properties.
119

119

00:05:50,330  -->  00:05:53,120
You really only use computer properties
120

120

00:05:53,120  -->  00:05:56,453
for outputting something like here, the full name.
