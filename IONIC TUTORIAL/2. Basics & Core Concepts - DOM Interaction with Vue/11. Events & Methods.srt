00:00:02,100  -->  00:00:04,910
<v Maximilian>Now we learned how to listen to events.</v>
2

2

00:00:04,910  -->  00:00:06,840
Now here's one important thing.
3

3

00:00:06,840  -->  00:00:11,170
Currently, I'm updating the counter here in my HTML code.
4

4

00:00:11,170  -->  00:00:15,100
In the Vue control parts, but in the HTML code
5

5

00:00:15,100  -->  00:00:19,380
and it's generally is considered a bad
6

6

00:00:19,380  -->  00:00:23,130
or not optimal practice to do that.
7

7

00:00:23,130  -->  00:00:28,070
You don't wanna put too much logic into your HTML code.
8

8

00:00:28,070  -->  00:00:30,270
Instead, the HTML code should really
9

9

00:00:30,270  -->  00:00:32,483
just be about outputting stuff.
10

10

00:00:33,720  -->  00:00:36,580
Logic like this, even though it's not too complex,
11

11

00:00:36,580  -->  00:00:39,770
should typically go into your JavaScript code.
12

12

00:00:39,770  -->  00:00:44,363
Now how could we get this logic into our JavaScript code?
13

13

00:00:45,490  -->  00:00:48,370
Well, we wanna do something on every click.
14

14

00:00:48,370  -->  00:00:49,890
What do you typically use
15

15

00:00:49,890  -->  00:00:53,730
if you wanna do something at a certain point of time,
16

16

00:00:53,730  -->  00:00:56,430
potentially in a repeated way?
17

17

00:00:56,430  -->  00:00:58,690
Well, you need a function that can be called.
18

18

00:00:58,690  -->  00:00:59,630
You need a function,
19

19

00:00:59,630  -->  00:01:01,920
which you can call when the Add button is clicked
20

20

00:01:01,920  -->  00:01:03,610
and you need a function which you can call
21

21

00:01:03,610  -->  00:01:05,310
when the Reduce button is clicked.
22

22

00:01:06,420  -->  00:01:11,420
Now of course, we could specify a function here, add,
23

23

00:01:11,520  -->  00:01:15,010
and there, try to set counter equal to counter plus one.
24

24

00:01:15,010  -->  00:01:16,390
But for multiple reasons,
25

25

00:01:16,390  -->  00:01:17,690
this wouldn't work
26

26

00:01:17,690  -->  00:01:21,320
for one counter is not a globally available variable,
27

27

00:01:21,320  -->  00:01:23,220
it is a data property,
28

28

00:01:23,220  -->  00:01:25,400
hence it's not available here.
29

29

00:01:25,400  -->  00:01:27,560
In addition, even if it would be available
30

30

00:01:27,560  -->  00:01:28,950
for whatever reason,
31

31

00:01:28,950  -->  00:01:33,350
add now is a globally created function.
32

32

00:01:33,350  -->  00:01:36,680
But in your Vue controlled HTML code,
33

33

00:01:36,680  -->  00:01:38,780
you can't use such a function.
34

34

00:01:38,780  -->  00:01:43,330
You can only use in this Vue controlled HTML part,
35

35

00:01:43,330  -->  00:01:46,290
what is defined in your Vue app.
36

36

00:01:46,290  -->  00:01:48,550
And that's why we use methods for that,
37

37

00:01:48,550  -->  00:01:51,280
and we did already learn about methods before.
38

38

00:01:51,280  -->  00:01:55,000
Now, we don't just use methods to manually call them
39

39

00:01:55,000  -->  00:01:58,840
as we did before, we can also use methods to connect them,
40

40

00:01:58,840  -->  00:02:02,140
to event listeners and let Vue call them for us
41

41

00:02:02,140  -->  00:02:04,260
when a certain event occurs.
42

42

00:02:04,260  -->  00:02:07,180
For example, here, we can add a add method,
43

43

00:02:07,180  -->  00:02:10,060
though this name here is totally up to you,
44

44

00:02:10,060  -->  00:02:13,180
you could also name it add counter or increment
45

45

00:02:13,180  -->  00:02:15,700
or whatever you want, but I'll name it add.
46

46

00:02:15,700  -->  00:02:20,030
And in here, you can now update this counter,
47

47

00:02:20,030  -->  00:02:24,100
just important as you learned with this counter.
48

48

00:02:24,100  -->  00:02:25,530
In your JavaScript code,
49

49

00:02:25,530  -->  00:02:29,510
you refer to your data properties with this.
50

50

00:02:29,510  -->  00:02:31,510
This counter plus plus,
51

51

00:02:31,510  -->  00:02:34,240
or the longer form this counter
52

52

00:02:34,240  -->  00:02:37,760
equals this counter plus one, it's the same.
53

53

00:02:37,760  -->  00:02:41,390
And with that, we have a method which we can call
54

54

00:02:41,390  -->  00:02:43,440
to update our counter.
55

55

00:02:43,440  -->  00:02:45,430
Now this method doesn't return anything
56

56

00:02:45,430  -->  00:02:47,120
because it doesn't have to.
57

57

00:02:47,120  -->  00:02:50,040
We'll not use the method like we did before
58

58

00:02:50,040  -->  00:02:52,960
to dynamically output something here.
59

59

00:02:52,960  -->  00:02:57,330
Instead, we're using it to run it when a click occurs
60

60

00:02:57,330  -->  00:02:59,570
and therefore, this does need to return anything
61

61

00:02:59,570  -->  00:03:03,370
because the click listener doesn't want a return value.
62

62

00:03:03,370  -->  00:03:07,350
So now here, we can call add like this
63

63

00:03:07,350  -->  00:03:10,450
and if I now saved it and reload, I can click add
64

64

00:03:10,450  -->  00:03:14,010
and it still works because we're executing the same code
65

65

00:03:14,010  -->  00:03:16,040
just in a different way.
66

66

00:03:16,040  -->  00:03:18,990
And this is actually the batter way of doing it,
67

67

00:03:18,990  -->  00:03:21,200
putting your logic into JavaScript
68

68

00:03:21,200  -->  00:03:23,640
and just pointing at that logic.
69

69

00:03:23,640  -->  00:03:26,550
That is generally considered better,
70

70

00:03:26,550  -->  00:03:29,720
even though technically, it here works in the same way.
71

71

00:03:29,720  -->  00:03:33,170
But consider cases where you have more complex logic
72

72

00:03:33,170  -->  00:03:36,110
and it quickly makes sense that you should put that logic
73

73

00:03:36,110  -->  00:03:39,350
into JavaScript and not into HTML.
74

74

00:03:39,350  -->  00:03:42,220
So it's not bad to get started with that as a habit,
75

75

00:03:42,220  -->  00:03:43,413
right from the start.
76

76

00:03:45,100  -->  00:03:48,230
Now besides calling add like this, by the way,
77

77

00:03:48,230  -->  00:03:50,660
you can also just point at it
78

78

00:03:50,660  -->  00:03:53,927
so that you tell Vue, "Hey, that's the name of the function
79

79

00:03:53,927  -->  00:03:56,337
"or of the method to be precise.
80

80

00:03:56,337  -->  00:03:58,940
"You should execute when a click occurs."
81

81

00:03:58,940  -->  00:04:03,530
Vue accepts both, you explicitly calling it like this,
82

82

00:04:03,530  -->  00:04:05,460
or you pointing at it,
83

83

00:04:05,460  -->  00:04:07,330
Vue detects what you're doing,
84

84

00:04:07,330  -->  00:04:09,923
and it will do the right thing in both cases.
85

85

00:04:10,820  -->  00:04:13,220
Now typically, you just wanna point at it
86

86

00:04:13,220  -->  00:04:16,200
since that is closer to vanilla JavaScript
87

87

00:04:16,200  -->  00:04:19,030
and how you would set up an event listener there
88

88

00:04:19,030  -->  00:04:23,110
but it is worth noting that both syntaxes are allowed
89

89

00:04:23,110  -->  00:04:24,860
as you can see here.
90

90

00:04:24,860  -->  00:04:28,513
Well, and now let's do the same for reducing our counter.
91

91

00:04:29,370  -->  00:04:30,760
Of course, try this on your own.
92

92

00:04:30,760  -->  00:04:32,650
Here's a quick pause for you to do that
93

93

00:04:32,650  -->  00:04:34,550
and there after, we'll do it together.
94

94

00:04:37,380  -->  00:04:38,910
Were you successful?
95

95

00:04:38,910  -->  00:04:41,870
Well, again, it's pretty much the same code.
96

96

00:04:41,870  -->  00:04:45,530
We can add a reduce method,
97

97

00:04:45,530  -->  00:04:47,610
again, this name is up to you
98

98

00:04:47,610  -->  00:04:49,470
and in there, we just set this counter
99

99

00:04:49,470  -->  00:04:53,940
equal to this counter minus one, or we use the shorter form,
100

100

00:04:53,940  -->  00:04:56,083
which looks like this, which is also okay.
101

101

00:04:58,500  -->  00:05:01,730
And now in here on this second button,
102

102

00:05:01,730  -->  00:05:06,020
we can call reduce like this, or as I just mentioned,
103

103

00:05:06,020  -->  00:05:08,570
just point at it, both is accepted.
104

104

00:05:08,570  -->  00:05:11,020
And now we've got our working buttons
105

105

00:05:11,020  -->  00:05:12,800
with one important change,
106

106

00:05:12,800  -->  00:05:16,820
now the logic is outsourced into JavaScript,
107

107

00:05:16,820  -->  00:05:19,160
which is where your logic should be
108

108

00:05:19,160  -->  00:05:22,460
and the HTML code is cleaner
109

109

00:05:22,460  -->  00:05:23,750
and this is better.
110

110

00:05:23,750  -->  00:05:25,400
This is considered to be better,
111

111

00:05:25,400  -->  00:05:28,860
so it is a good idea to get started with this approach
112

112

00:05:28,860  -->  00:05:30,453
and with this pattern.
113

113

00:05:32,320  -->  00:05:35,380
Now that is how we can use methods.
114

114

00:05:35,380  -->  00:05:40,340
We cannot just use them in curly braces or with the bind
115

115

00:05:40,340  -->  00:05:44,200
to dynamically derive a value we wanna output
116

116

00:05:44,200  -->  00:05:47,360
but we can also use them with event listeners
117

117

00:05:47,360  -->  00:05:49,740
to define codes that should be executed
118

118

00:05:49,740  -->  00:05:52,010
when the event occurs.
119

119

00:05:52,010  -->  00:05:55,530
And in reality, you will more often use methods
120

120

00:05:55,530  -->  00:05:57,160
to connect them to events,
121

121

00:05:57,160  -->  00:05:58,420
than you will use them
122

122

00:05:58,420  -->  00:06:01,030
to output something dynamically derived.
123

123

00:06:01,030  -->  00:06:04,360
I just showed this before to show you that it's possible
124

124

00:06:04,360  -->  00:06:06,280
and to introduce methods
125

125

00:06:06,280  -->  00:06:08,660
but typically, you'll use them like this
126

126

00:06:08,660  -->  00:06:10,543
in combination with event listeners.
