00:00:02,320  -->  00:00:05,190
<v Instructor>Now binding inline styles dynamically</v>
2

2

00:00:05,190  -->  00:00:07,820
as we're doing it here works,
3

3

00:00:07,820  -->  00:00:11,200
but inline styles have a couple of disadvantages.
4

4

00:00:11,200  -->  00:00:13,870
They overrule all other styles,
5

5

00:00:13,870  -->  00:00:15,970
which sometimes is what you'll need,
6

6

00:00:15,970  -->  00:00:17,980
but often leads to problems.
7

7

00:00:17,980  -->  00:00:21,610
Therefore in modern web development and CSS,
8

8

00:00:21,610  -->  00:00:25,040
we typically don't use inline styles too often.
9

9

00:00:25,040  -->  00:00:27,070
So, let's actually get rid of that
10

10

00:00:27,070  -->  00:00:29,580
and let me instead show you something else.
11

11

00:00:29,580  -->  00:00:32,930
How we can bind CSS classes dynamically,
12

12

00:00:32,930  -->  00:00:36,600
because that's an alternative approach we could use here.
13

13

00:00:36,600  -->  00:00:39,830
Let's for a moment, go to styles, CSS,
14

14

00:00:39,830  -->  00:00:42,270
and let's add a new CSS class here,
15

15

00:00:42,270  -->  00:00:45,780
a new CSS as class selector, I'll name it active,
16

16

00:00:45,780  -->  00:00:47,820
but you can use any name you want.
17

17

00:00:47,820  -->  00:00:50,890
And the only rule or the only property
18

18

00:00:50,890  -->  00:00:53,980
I'll style in there is border color,
19

19

00:00:53,980  -->  00:00:55,560
which is set to red.
20

20

00:00:55,560  -->  00:00:57,860
Well actually to make it even easier to see,
21

21

00:00:57,860  -->  00:01:00,330
let me also change the background color to salmon
22

22

00:01:01,675  -->  00:01:03,310
but this is optional.
23

23

00:01:03,310  -->  00:01:06,750
So, now we have to this active CSS class here
24

24

00:01:06,750  -->  00:01:10,340
in the CSS file, which we can now close.
25

25

00:01:10,340  -->  00:01:14,950
And now let's say we wanna add this class dynamically
26

26

00:01:15,820  -->  00:01:20,803
to this div if boxASelected is true.
27

27

00:01:21,810  -->  00:01:23,460
So, therefore of course,
28

28

00:01:23,460  -->  00:01:27,630
we can bind the class attribute dynamically
29

29

00:01:27,630  -->  00:01:32,463
with V bind or this shorthand with just colon class.
30

30

00:01:33,770  -->  00:01:37,600
Now class of course needs a string now.
31

31

00:01:37,600  -->  00:01:39,950
The name of the class that should be added, for example,
32

32

00:01:39,950  -->  00:01:44,070
demo, which is responsible for this default box style,
33

33

00:01:44,070  -->  00:01:46,730
that's why I'm passing in a string here.
34

34

00:01:46,730  -->  00:01:48,590
But we could now make sure
35

35

00:01:48,590  -->  00:01:51,350
that we pass more than just that string
36

36

00:01:51,350  -->  00:01:55,430
if indeed box A is selected.
37

37

00:01:55,430  -->  00:01:58,720
So, if box A is selected here is true.
38

38

00:01:58,720  -->  00:02:01,123
And for that we could again check boxASelected,
39

39

00:02:01,970  -->  00:02:05,870
so, check this property in a ternary expression.
40

40

00:02:05,870  -->  00:02:07,810
We can use JavaScript here now
41

41

00:02:07,810  -->  00:02:10,620
because we're binding this with V bind.
42

42

00:02:10,620  -->  00:02:15,620
Check if that's true, if it is, we add demo and active.
43

43

00:02:15,960  -->  00:02:17,030
This needs to be a string
44

44

00:02:17,030  -->  00:02:20,330
because this is all evaluated as JavaScript here
45

45

00:02:20,330  -->  00:02:22,910
and we wanna return a string with these classes,
46

46

00:02:22,910  -->  00:02:25,420
two class if that is selected.
47

47

00:02:25,420  -->  00:02:28,673
Else, in this ternary expression, we'll just add to demo.
48

48

00:02:29,690  -->  00:02:33,930
So, that active is only added if box A is selected as true.
49

49

00:02:33,930  -->  00:02:36,293
And if I reload, this works.
50

50

00:02:37,150  -->  00:02:40,950
However, this is not the nicest code,
51

51

00:02:40,950  -->  00:02:42,330
it's a bit hard to read
52

52

00:02:42,330  -->  00:02:46,110
and imagine how difficult this would be to read
53

53

00:02:46,110  -->  00:02:51,110
if we had more classes that we wanna toggle dynamically.
54

54

00:02:51,300  -->  00:02:54,470
Thankfully, just as with style,
55

55

00:02:54,470  -->  00:02:58,000
Vue JS supports a special syntax,
56

56

00:02:58,000  -->  00:03:01,050
especially for the class attribute as well
57

57

00:03:01,050  -->  00:03:03,930
if you're binding it with V bind.
58

58

00:03:03,930  -->  00:03:06,140
You can pass an object here as well,
59

59

00:03:06,140  -->  00:03:08,280
which normally would not work.
60

60

00:03:08,280  -->  00:03:11,800
If you don't bind it, that does not make any sense.
61

61

00:03:11,800  -->  00:03:16,100
But if you do bind it Vue supports this object syntax
62

62

00:03:16,100  -->  00:03:19,030
and in there you can now add properties
63

63

00:03:19,030  -->  00:03:23,880
where the property names reflect your CSS classes
64

64

00:03:23,880  -->  00:03:28,880
and the values of those properties are true or false
65

65

00:03:29,060  -->  00:03:31,610
or a true, few or false the result,
66

66

00:03:31,610  -->  00:03:34,510
that indicates whether that class should be added.
67

67

00:03:34,510  -->  00:03:36,810
So, we could add demo as a key name,
68

68

00:03:36,810  -->  00:03:39,770
as a property name and set it to true
69

69

00:03:39,770  -->  00:03:44,280
so that demo is always added and add active
70

70

00:03:44,280  -->  00:03:47,453
and set the value of active to boxASelected
71

71

00:03:48,610  -->  00:03:52,530
so that the active class is added to this div
72

72

00:03:52,530  -->  00:03:54,853
if boxASelected is truthy.
73

73

00:03:55,910  -->  00:03:57,410
And if we saved it and reload,
74

74

00:03:57,410  -->  00:03:59,690
we've got the same behavior as before,
75

75

00:03:59,690  -->  00:04:02,175
but with much more readable code,
76

76

00:04:02,175  -->  00:04:05,700
especially if we add more and more classes here,
77

77

00:04:05,700  -->  00:04:08,810
this stays readable and stays maintainable,
78

78

00:04:08,810  -->  00:04:11,213
which of course is super important.
79

79

00:04:12,340  -->  00:04:16,030
And now we could do the same on the other divs as well.
80

80

00:04:16,030  -->  00:04:17,840
But actually before we do that,
81

81

00:04:17,840  -->  00:04:20,250
I wanna simplify that even more.
82

82

00:04:20,250  -->  00:04:22,910
Setting demo to true is a bit redundant,
83

83

00:04:22,910  -->  00:04:25,620
we always add to that class.
84

84

00:04:25,620  -->  00:04:28,890
So therefore, thankfully we can remove it from here,
85

85

00:04:28,890  -->  00:04:30,690
remove it from this object
86

86

00:04:30,690  -->  00:04:33,570
and instead add the class attribute like this
87

87

00:04:33,570  -->  00:04:34,960
and set it to demo
88

88

00:04:34,960  -->  00:04:39,620
and have our dynamically bound class attribute in addition.
89

89

00:04:39,620  -->  00:04:42,260
So, this one here is not dynamically bound,
90

90

00:04:42,260  -->  00:04:44,170
I'm not having a colon here.
91

91

00:04:44,170  -->  00:04:47,020
So, that's the regular class attribute
92

92

00:04:47,020  -->  00:04:48,910
and I'll set it to demo.
93

93

00:04:48,910  -->  00:04:51,730
And Vue will basically just recognize that
94

94

00:04:51,730  -->  00:04:53,750
and never change it.
95

95

00:04:53,750  -->  00:04:56,150
But then I also to bind class dynamically
96

96

00:04:56,150  -->  00:05:00,200
and what Vue will do is it will evaluate the result
97

97

00:05:00,200  -->  00:05:02,740
of this dynamic class binding
98

98

00:05:02,740  -->  00:05:06,420
and merge it with the hard-coded one here.
99

99

00:05:06,420  -->  00:05:09,560
With that if I reload, we get the same behavior as before,
100

100

00:05:09,560  -->  00:05:13,590
but with even less code or even easier to manage code,
101

101

00:05:13,590  -->  00:05:14,423
I should say.
102

102

00:05:15,600  -->  00:05:19,620
Well then of course, now we can easily bring that over
103

103

00:05:19,620  -->  00:05:23,040
to the other divs as well, if we want to
104

104

00:05:23,040  -->  00:05:26,590
and just check for boxBSelected and boxCSelected.
105

105

00:05:30,070  -->  00:05:33,570
And with that, we can highlight those boxes as well.
106

106

00:05:33,570  -->  00:05:36,860
We cannot unmark them at the moment,
107

107

00:05:36,860  -->  00:05:40,430
but still, this is how you can add dynamic classes
108

108

00:05:40,430  -->  00:05:42,983
and dynamic styling with Vue.
109

109

00:05:44,600  -->  00:05:45,970
Now, if you wanna make sure that users
110

110

00:05:45,970  -->  00:05:49,770
can actually toggle this and not just mark it as active,
111

111

00:05:49,770  -->  00:05:52,810
we can simply go to our code and change this a little bit
112

112

00:05:52,810  -->  00:05:55,170
and instead of setting this boxASelected
113

113

00:05:55,170  -->  00:05:58,800
to true all the time, I'll set it to the opposite
114

114

00:05:58,800  -->  00:06:00,903
of this boxASelected
115

115

00:06:00,903  -->  00:06:04,840
so that in the end, if box A was selected,
116

116

00:06:04,840  -->  00:06:07,570
if it was true, it's now false,
117

117

00:06:07,570  -->  00:06:09,360
thanks to this exclamation mark.
118

118

00:06:09,360  -->  00:06:12,493
And this false value is the new value for boxASelected,
119

119

00:06:13,590  -->  00:06:17,100
and I'll do the same for the other boxes.
120

120

00:06:17,100  -->  00:06:19,840
And with this simple adjustment,
121

121

00:06:19,840  -->  00:06:23,190
we ensure that this now is a toggleable,
122

122

00:06:23,190  -->  00:06:26,760
that we can toggle this and not just set it as active,
123

123

00:06:26,760  -->  00:06:29,453
but also set it as inactive.
