00:00:02,290  -->  00:00:03,730
<v Instructor>Now you can also,</v>
2

2

00:00:03,730  -->  00:00:06,880
utilize Computed Properties here if you want.
3

3

00:00:06,880  -->  00:00:10,810
Because I mentioned having Logic in the HTML Code
4

4

00:00:10,810  -->  00:00:12,490
is suboptimal.
5

5

00:00:12,490  -->  00:00:15,770
Now, for it as class binding, it actually is okay.
6

6

00:00:15,770  -->  00:00:18,440
But if you want to move this Logic here,
7

7

00:00:18,440  -->  00:00:20,310
out of the HTML Code.
8

8

00:00:20,310  -->  00:00:23,690
Well, you can simply add Computed Properties here
9

9

00:00:23,690  -->  00:00:27,750
in your Vue Config Object by adding the Computed Key.
10

10

00:00:27,750  -->  00:00:32,750
And in there any name of your choice, like, "Box A Classes,"
11

11

00:00:33,210  -->  00:00:35,450
because here I wanna derive the classes
12

12

00:00:35,450  -->  00:00:37,960
that should be added to box A
13

13

00:00:37,960  -->  00:00:41,040
and then simply put this Logic.
14

14

00:00:41,040  -->  00:00:41,873
Ops.
15

15

00:00:43,720  -->  00:00:45,580
This Logic here,
16

16

00:00:45,580  -->  00:00:48,860
which I'm binding to my first box in here
17

17

00:00:48,860  -->  00:00:52,500
and return it here, return as object in box A classes,
18

18

00:00:52,500  -->  00:00:57,500
and then bind class here to box A classes,
19

19

00:00:58,570  -->  00:00:59,870
just like that.
20

20

00:00:59,870  -->  00:01:01,570
If I reload,
21

21

00:01:01,570  -->  00:01:04,843
it crashes because of course this now shouldn't be this box
22

22

00:01:04,843  -->  00:01:08,700
I selected here since I'm now inside of my Vue app.
23

23

00:01:08,700  -->  00:01:10,200
But now if I reload,
24

24

00:01:10,200  -->  00:01:14,090
this works just before with a Computed Property.
25

25

00:01:14,090  -->  00:01:16,530
This can especially be helpful
26

26

00:01:16,530  -->  00:01:19,910
if you have more complex dynamic class code,
27

27

00:01:19,910  -->  00:01:21,620
if you're not just referring
28

28

00:01:21,620  -->  00:01:23,830
to a true or false Boolean here,
29

29

00:01:23,830  -->  00:01:26,030
but if you had a more complex check
30

30

00:01:26,030  -->  00:01:28,080
or different if statements here
31

31

00:01:28,080  -->  00:01:30,720
where you want to return different objects.
32

32

00:01:30,720  -->  00:01:33,510
In such cases as always Computed Properties
33

33

00:01:33,510  -->  00:01:34,710
can shine a lot,
34

34

00:01:34,710  -->  00:01:36,110
but you can also use it here
35

35

00:01:36,110  -->  00:01:39,030
to simplify your HTML Code a bit more
36

36

00:01:39,030  -->  00:01:42,010
and move that Logic into JavaScript.
37

37

00:01:42,010  -->  00:01:43,220
It's optional here, though.
38

38

00:01:43,220  -->  00:01:45,100
You can do it, but for a styling
39

39

00:01:45,100  -->  00:01:46,300
for dynamic styling,
40

40

00:01:46,300  -->  00:01:48,930
it's definitely not a must do,
41

41

00:01:48,930  -->  00:01:51,470
unless you have very complex code
42

42

00:01:51,470  -->  00:01:54,813
for finding out whether a class should be added or not.
