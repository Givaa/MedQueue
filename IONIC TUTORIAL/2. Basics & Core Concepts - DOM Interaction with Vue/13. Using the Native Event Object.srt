1

00:00:02,110  -->  00:00:03,760
<v Instructor>So this is taking shape.</v>
2

2

00:00:03,760  -->  00:00:08,310
Let's now enhanced his mini dummy app here a little bit.
3

3

00:00:08,310  -->  00:00:12,650
And let's add an input of type text here, just like this.
4

4

00:00:12,650  -->  00:00:16,240
And below that paragraph where I say Your Name
5

5

00:00:16,240  -->  00:00:18,570
and in here, I wanna output the username.
6

6

00:00:18,570  -->  00:00:21,400
But now the user should be able to enter the name
7

7

00:00:21,400  -->  00:00:25,500
in this input here, that's the new thing.
8

8

00:00:25,500  -->  00:00:28,833
So we can have a name field here in our data.
9

9

00:00:29,730  -->  00:00:33,380
Initially it could be empty or your name, whatever you want.
10

10

00:00:33,380  -->  00:00:35,810
And we can output the name here
11

11

00:00:35,810  -->  00:00:37,453
with the double curly braces.
12

12

00:00:38,500  -->  00:00:40,600
But now I also have this input here
13

13

00:00:40,600  -->  00:00:44,030
and whenever I type in here, I want to update the name,
14

14

00:00:44,030  -->  00:00:46,473
which is output in this paragraph.
15

15

00:00:47,320  -->  00:00:48,823
Now, how could we do that?
16

16

00:00:50,330  -->  00:00:53,260
Well, now that we learned about listening to events,
17

17

00:00:53,260  -->  00:00:56,130
we should have all the tools we need for that.
18

18

00:00:56,130  -->  00:00:59,360
We can add an event listener with v-on
19

19

00:00:59,360  -->  00:01:02,270
and now of course, I don't wanna listen to the click event,
20

20

00:01:02,270  -->  00:01:04,360
but to every keystroke.
21

21

00:01:04,360  -->  00:01:07,170
We could do it as with keyup or keydown,
22

22

00:01:07,170  -->  00:01:10,220
which all have their special behaviors.
23

23

00:01:10,220  -->  00:01:15,220
The best event to listen to on an input HTML element
24

24

00:01:15,650  -->  00:01:17,640
is the input event.
25

25

00:01:17,640  -->  00:01:19,820
Which is a default Dom event
26

26

00:01:19,820  -->  00:01:23,650
available on input elements, nothing Vue specific.
27

27

00:01:23,650  -->  00:01:25,330
You can listen to the input event
28

28

00:01:25,330  -->  00:01:27,203
in vanilla JavaScript as well.
29

29

00:01:28,180  -->  00:01:32,280
Here with v-on I'm telling Vue that I want to listen
30

30

00:01:32,280  -->  00:01:36,270
to this input event on this input element.
31

31

00:01:36,270  -->  00:01:37,660
And there for now, again,
32

32

00:01:37,660  -->  00:01:41,020
we can specify to code between these double quotes
33

33

00:01:41,020  -->  00:01:44,330
that should execute when an input event is admitted,
34

34

00:01:44,330  -->  00:01:46,860
which will be the case on every keystroke.
35

35

00:01:46,860  -->  00:01:50,223
That is how the input event is emitted by default.
36

36

00:01:51,330  -->  00:01:53,350
So now again, we could put the code in here
37

37

00:01:53,350  -->  00:01:56,770
or use this better approach of using a method.
38

38

00:01:56,770  -->  00:02:00,333
So I'll do that, add a little method here,
39

39

00:02:00,333  -->  00:02:02,990
setName could be the method name,
40

40

00:02:02,990  -->  00:02:04,850
because that's what we're going to do.
41

41

00:02:04,850  -->  00:02:06,060
Again, the name is up to you,
42

42

00:02:06,060  -->  00:02:07,870
but of course you wanna name the method
43

43

00:02:07,870  -->  00:02:10,490
such that it describes what it's going to do.
44

44

00:02:10,490  -->  00:02:11,890
So here I'll use setName
45

45

00:02:13,250  -->  00:02:15,630
and then I want to set this name.
46

46

00:02:15,630  -->  00:02:20,530
So this name property, which we added to our data object
47

47

00:02:20,530  -->  00:02:23,150
equal to what the user entered.
48

48

00:02:23,150  -->  00:02:25,790
And that's going to be a bit tricky, won't it?
49

49

00:02:25,790  -->  00:02:28,280
Because how do we know what the user entered?
50

50

00:02:28,280  -->  00:02:30,510
We know that the user entered something
51

51

00:02:30,510  -->  00:02:32,560
because we're listening to that event,
52

52

00:02:32,560  -->  00:02:35,883
but how do we get the concrete value the user entered?
53

53

00:02:37,460  -->  00:02:41,680
While there is a built in behavior built into JavaScript,
54

54

00:02:41,680  -->  00:02:44,570
not into Vue, which we can leverage.
55

55

00:02:44,570  -->  00:02:48,440
First of all, we can point at the setName method here,
56

56

00:02:48,440  -->  00:02:52,410
which is the method we wanna execute on every keystroke.
57

57

00:02:52,410  -->  00:02:55,360
And now there's a cool behavior in JavaScript,
58

58

00:02:55,360  -->  00:02:59,010
not in Vue, Vue just also is able to use it.
59

59

00:02:59,010  -->  00:03:01,340
When you add an event listener
60

60

00:03:01,340  -->  00:03:04,180
and you then point at a function that should be executed
61

61

00:03:04,180  -->  00:03:05,780
when that event occurs.
62

62

00:03:05,780  -->  00:03:10,680
That function will automatically get one argument.
63

63

00:03:10,680  -->  00:03:12,130
The browser will ensure
64

64

00:03:12,130  -->  00:03:14,360
that this argument is provided so to say.
65

65

00:03:14,360  -->  00:03:16,760
And that will be an object
66

66

00:03:16,760  -->  00:03:19,373
describing the event that occurred.
67

67

00:03:21,760  -->  00:03:23,510
So here in setName,
68

68

00:03:23,510  -->  00:03:27,540
we can accept this one argument, this one parameter.
69

69

00:03:27,540  -->  00:03:29,440
You can name it however you want,
70

70

00:03:29,440  -->  00:03:32,223
but you will always get this by the browser.
71

71

00:03:33,410  -->  00:03:37,160
We would have gotten this here for add and reduce as well.
72

72

00:03:37,160  -->  00:03:38,640
We just overrode it
73

73

00:03:38,640  -->  00:03:42,530
with our own custom argument, we're passing in.
74

74

00:03:42,530  -->  00:03:44,640
But since I'm not executing setName
75

75

00:03:44,640  -->  00:03:47,470
with parentheses here, but I am pointing edit,
76

76

00:03:47,470  -->  00:03:48,890
I don't override it.
77

77

00:03:48,890  -->  00:03:53,160
And I let the browser provide this default event object.
78

78

00:03:53,160  -->  00:03:54,840
And why is this useful?
79

79

00:03:54,840  -->  00:03:57,330
Because this default event object
80

80

00:03:57,330  -->  00:04:00,250
will be full of information about the event.
81

81

00:04:00,250  -->  00:04:02,660
And for example, it will give us information
82

82

00:04:02,660  -->  00:04:07,020
about the HTML element on which this event occurred,
83

83

00:04:07,020  -->  00:04:09,100
which is the input element.
84

84

00:04:09,100  -->  00:04:13,760
And we can then read the current value stored in this input
85

85

00:04:13,760  -->  00:04:16,630
from that input element.
86

86

00:04:16,630  -->  00:04:19,460
And we get access to the target off the event
87

87

00:04:19,460  -->  00:04:23,120
with events.target and that's vanilla JavaScript.
88

88

00:04:23,120  -->  00:04:24,950
This is nothing Vue specific.
89

89

00:04:24,950  -->  00:04:28,430
This would work in vanilla JavaScript as well.
90

90

00:04:28,430  -->  00:04:30,760
This gives us access to the element
91

91

00:04:30,760  -->  00:04:32,290
on which the event occurred.
92

92

00:04:32,290  -->  00:04:34,520
And this is the input element in this case,
93

93

00:04:34,520  -->  00:04:37,020
which will have a value property.
94

94

00:04:37,020  -->  00:04:40,070
Again, that's just vanilla javaScript
95

95

00:04:40,070  -->  00:04:42,480
and you can search for MDN input
96

96

00:04:42,480  -->  00:04:46,090
to find more documentation on this input element.
97

97

00:04:46,090  -->  00:04:50,270
And in here you will eventually somewhere find
98

98

00:04:50,270  -->  00:04:54,040
that this has a value property,
99

99

00:04:54,040  -->  00:04:57,680
which you can use to read what the user entered.
100

100

00:04:57,680  -->  00:04:59,720
So this will be the value to user entered,
101

101

00:04:59,720  -->  00:05:03,110
setName will be called on every input events.
102

102

00:05:03,110  -->  00:05:06,850
So on every keystroke and this should update the name,
103

103

00:05:06,850  -->  00:05:09,980
our data and it property here with every keystroke,
104

104

00:05:09,980  -->  00:05:13,153
with the value to user currently entered here.
105

105

00:05:14,450  -->  00:05:16,600
And then we're outputting name down there.
106

106

00:05:16,600  -->  00:05:18,630
And if we now save that in reload,
107

107

00:05:18,630  -->  00:05:22,360
I can enter Maximilian and you see how this updates
108

108

00:05:22,360  -->  00:05:23,903
in the paragraph below.
109

109

00:05:25,780  -->  00:05:29,040
And that's Vue's reactivity in action, again.
110

110

00:05:29,040  -->  00:05:33,220
It allows us to listen to this event and execute this code
111

111

00:05:33,220  -->  00:05:36,540
and it's then all the detects that name changed
112

112

00:05:36,540  -->  00:05:39,470
and updates it in the places on the page
113

113

00:05:39,470  -->  00:05:41,710
where updating is needed.
114

114

00:05:41,710  -->  00:05:43,120
And as a side note,
115

115

00:05:43,120  -->  00:05:46,050
if I inspect this here in the Chrome Dev Tools,
116

116

00:05:46,050  -->  00:05:49,900
there is something ever interesting which we can notice.
117

117

00:05:49,900  -->  00:05:54,360
If you watch this part on the right here this HTML code.
118

118

00:05:54,360  -->  00:05:55,730
You'll see that the parts
119

119

00:05:55,730  -->  00:05:59,160
that are rerendered the browser flash,
120

120

00:05:59,160  -->  00:06:02,690
you see the paragraph with my name flashes.
121

121

00:06:02,690  -->  00:06:04,010
Now you will also see
122

122

00:06:04,010  -->  00:06:06,200
that nothing else on the screen flashed.
123

123

00:06:06,200  -->  00:06:08,300
For example, the counter didn't flash.
124

124

00:06:08,300  -->  00:06:12,370
This counter only flashes. If I changed the counter.
125

125

00:06:12,370  -->  00:06:13,600
Now these are the parts
126

126

00:06:13,600  -->  00:06:16,510
which are actually rerendered on the screen.
127

127

00:06:16,510  -->  00:06:20,710
And you see that only the parts that really changed in code
128

128

00:06:20,710  -->  00:06:23,940
are rerendered on the screen and that's important.
129

129

00:06:23,940  -->  00:06:27,770
If Vue would update the entire screen,
130

130

00:06:27,770  -->  00:06:30,720
whenever something changed somewhere,
131

131

00:06:30,720  -->  00:06:32,713
this would be bad for performance.
132

132

00:06:33,890  -->  00:06:36,810
Instead Vue is really smart and it sees that
133

133

00:06:36,810  -->  00:06:39,890
with every keystroke here, only the name changes.
134

134

00:06:39,890  -->  00:06:44,050
And hence it only finds the places where I used the name,
135

135

00:06:44,050  -->  00:06:47,260
in this case, this paragraph and update stat
136

136

00:06:47,260  -->  00:06:50,130
and the rest is well left untouched.
137

137

00:06:50,130  -->  00:06:53,763
And hence we save performance or have a better performance.
138

138

00:06:54,800  -->  00:06:58,210
Now, this is how we can work with events.
139

139

00:06:58,210  -->  00:07:02,540
There's just one more note about this default event object.
140

140

00:07:02,540  -->  00:07:06,310
You could have a scenario that you need to call
141

141

00:07:06,310  -->  00:07:09,170
your method explicitly on your own here
142

142

00:07:09,170  -->  00:07:11,760
as we did it with add and reduce.
143

143

00:07:11,760  -->  00:07:12,790
For example,
144

144

00:07:12,790  -->  00:07:16,420
because you need to pass in some other argument,
145

145

00:07:16,420  -->  00:07:19,913
like second name, which I always want to use here.
146

146

00:07:21,880  -->  00:07:26,880
We could accept this here, second name or last name
147

147

00:07:27,620  -->  00:07:30,730
and then update name with whatever the user entered
148

148

00:07:30,730  -->  00:07:35,623
plus last name, maybe also add a white space in front of it.
149

149

00:07:37,790  -->  00:07:40,920
The problem with that is that we now no longer
150

150

00:07:40,920  -->  00:07:45,120
get this default event object as a first argument here.
151

151

00:07:45,120  -->  00:07:49,130
Now to still pass that in, there is a special variable,
152

152

00:07:49,130  -->  00:07:51,100
which you can use here in your template
153

153

00:07:51,100  -->  00:07:53,570
and that's dollar sign event.
154

154

00:07:53,570  -->  00:07:57,470
This is a reserved name and Vue gives this variable to you
155

155

00:07:57,470  -->  00:08:01,630
to give you access to this built in default event object,
156

156

00:08:01,630  -->  00:08:04,560
which you get automatically by the browser.
157

157

00:08:04,560  -->  00:08:07,430
So that you can use it here in this code as well.
158

158

00:08:07,430  -->  00:08:12,050
And for example, still pass it in as a first argument
159

159

00:08:12,050  -->  00:08:13,693
to setName, if you wanted to.
160

160

00:08:14,740  -->  00:08:18,350
So whenever you find yourself using an arguments here
161

161

00:08:18,350  -->  00:08:21,510
or you simply can't just point at a function
162

162

00:08:21,510  -->  00:08:25,040
for whatever reason and you need that built in event,
163

163

00:08:25,040  -->  00:08:28,190
you can access it with dollar sign event.
164

164

00:08:28,190  -->  00:08:31,090
But again, this is only needed if you're not just
165

165

00:08:31,090  -->  00:08:33,970
pointing at the method as we did it before.
166

166

00:08:33,970  -->  00:08:38,300
Hence now if a reload, this still all works as before,
167

167

00:08:38,300  -->  00:08:41,280
but now with help of dollar sign event.
168

168

00:08:41,280  -->  00:08:42,860
That's just in our side note,
169

169

00:08:42,860  -->  00:08:46,040
because sometimes this is exactly what you need
170

170

00:08:46,040  -->  00:08:48,670
to get access to both to build an event object
171

171

00:08:48,670  -->  00:08:51,940
you get automatically and still execute code
172

172

00:08:51,940  -->  00:08:53,460
on your own explicitly,
173

173

00:08:53,460  -->  00:08:56,983
for example, to pass in your own arguments.
