00:00:02,310  -->  00:00:04,040
<v Maximilian>So, now before we dive</v>
2

2

00:00:04,040  -->  00:00:05,550
into our first practice
3

3

00:00:05,550  -->  00:00:07,970
of those key features you learned about.
4

4

00:00:07,970  -->  00:00:10,480
It's all the time for our first brief summary
5

5

00:00:10,480  -->  00:00:11,770
of what we learned.
6

6

00:00:11,770  -->  00:00:15,610
And we mostly learned about how to create Vue apps
7

7

00:00:15,610  -->  00:00:20,490
and how to connect them to HTML code with mount.
8

8

00:00:20,490  -->  00:00:24,340
That you should use some unique CSS selector here,
9

9

00:00:24,340  -->  00:00:27,930
like here the ID selector because every Vue app
10

10

00:00:27,930  -->  00:00:32,380
can only be connected to one HTML element.
11

11

00:00:32,380  -->  00:00:34,670
And you also see already that
12

12

00:00:34,670  -->  00:00:37,630
if you control an element with Vue,
13

13

00:00:37,630  -->  00:00:41,750
like here, where we are controlling this section with Vue.
14

14

00:00:41,750  -->  00:00:45,780
You automatically also control all child elements,
15

15

00:00:45,780  -->  00:00:48,530
but not any elements outside
16

16

00:00:48,530  -->  00:00:51,720
of this Vue controlled section in this case.
17

17

00:00:51,720  -->  00:00:55,860
So one Vue app can control one part in the HTML code,
18

18

00:00:55,860  -->  00:00:57,930
but it then automatically controls
19

19

00:00:57,930  -->  00:01:00,620
all child elements as well.
20

20

00:01:00,620  -->  00:01:04,680
Well, and in this Vue controlled HTML code,
21

21

00:01:04,680  -->  00:01:06,730
you can use special features.
22

22

00:01:06,730  -->  00:01:11,460
Like this interpolation syntax with the double curly braces
23

23

00:01:11,460  -->  00:01:15,460
or this binding syntax, this binding directive
24

24

00:01:15,460  -->  00:01:20,420
with v-bind or v-html, as you also saw before.
25

25

00:01:20,420  -->  00:01:22,970
These are features which are available
26

26

00:01:22,970  -->  00:01:26,520
in that Vue controlled HTML code.
27

27

00:01:26,520  -->  00:01:28,680
Now you can output data in there,
28

28

00:01:28,680  -->  00:01:32,860
Therefore this interpolation, and this binding syntax
29

29

00:01:32,860  -->  00:01:36,980
is also summarized under the term data binding.
30

30

00:01:36,980  -->  00:01:38,610
Because we're binding data,
31

31

00:01:38,610  -->  00:01:43,610
which be managed in our Vue app to the HTML code,
32

32

00:01:43,760  -->  00:01:45,650
either with the interpolation
33

33

00:01:45,650  -->  00:01:48,800
or with the v-bind directive syntax.
34

34

00:01:48,800  -->  00:01:50,700
And that's the important thing.
35

35

00:01:50,700  -->  00:01:54,010
You pass an object to your Vue app,
36

36

00:01:54,010  -->  00:01:55,980
which you create with createApp.
37

37

00:01:55,980  -->  00:01:59,110
And this object configures this app.
38

38

00:01:59,110  -->  00:02:02,130
You can set various options for example,
39

39

00:02:02,130  -->  00:02:05,540
the data option or the methods option.
40

40

00:02:05,540  -->  00:02:07,180
Obviously we're going to learn about
41

41

00:02:07,180  -->  00:02:08,790
other options for the course.
42

42

00:02:08,790  -->  00:02:11,840
But these are two super important options
43

43

00:02:11,840  -->  00:02:15,083
which you will probably meet in any app you're building.
44

44

00:02:16,350  -->  00:02:19,560
The data option takes a function,
45

45

00:02:19,560  -->  00:02:21,030
therefore you can write it like this.
46

46

00:02:21,030  -->  00:02:24,640
Which should return an object full of data.
47

47

00:02:24,640  -->  00:02:26,330
Which will then be available
48

48

00:02:26,330  -->  00:02:31,030
in your Vue controlled HTML code, like vueLink here,
49

49

00:02:31,030  -->  00:02:32,820
and which can also be accessed
50

50

00:02:32,820  -->  00:02:35,870
from inside your other parts of the Vue app.
51

51

00:02:35,870  -->  00:02:39,440
Like the methods with the this keyword.
52

52

00:02:39,440  -->  00:02:41,320
Methods are also important.
53

53

00:02:41,320  -->  00:02:43,630
These are functions which you can call
54

54

00:02:43,630  -->  00:02:47,920
from inside your Vue controlled HTML code, for example.
55

55

00:02:47,920  -->  00:02:50,120
And that's what you'll learn about this far.
56

56

00:02:51,030  -->  00:02:55,580
Now, therefore, when we work with a framework like Vue,
57

57

00:02:55,580  -->  00:02:59,960
we typically say that we use a declarative approach
58

58

00:02:59,960  -->  00:03:03,490
or that Vue uses a declarative approach.
59

59

00:03:03,490  -->  00:03:06,770
And that's just a fancy way of saying we,
60

60

00:03:06,770  -->  00:03:09,740
as a developer define the goal.
61

61

00:03:09,740  -->  00:03:12,310
We define a template, you could say,
62

62

00:03:12,310  -->  00:03:14,750
of the content we wanna have.
63

63

00:03:14,750  -->  00:03:19,350
We mark the parts which are dynamic like this one,
64

64

00:03:19,350  -->  00:03:21,610
or like this href attribute here,
65

65

00:03:21,610  -->  00:03:23,530
which is bound with v-bind,
66

66

00:03:23,530  -->  00:03:27,250
and Vue will then do the rest for us.
67

67

00:03:27,250  -->  00:03:29,200
It does all the magic behind the scenes.
68

68

00:03:29,200  -->  00:03:33,020
It outputs concrete values here and here.
69

69

00:03:33,020  -->  00:03:34,980
And it updates the real DOM.
70

70

00:03:34,980  -->  00:03:38,590
Which is rendered to the screen and what the user sees
71

71

00:03:38,590  -->  00:03:41,790
behind the scenes on our behalf.
72

72

00:03:41,790  -->  00:03:46,150
So we, as a developer just define the final picture
73

73

00:03:46,150  -->  00:03:48,920
with the dynamic placeholders you could say,
74

74

00:03:48,920  -->  00:03:51,039
and we don't define all the steps
75

75

00:03:51,039  -->  00:03:53,850
of getting that picture onto the screen.
76

76

00:03:53,850  -->  00:03:57,120
That's what we do with a framework like Vue.
77

77

00:03:57,120  -->  00:04:00,090
And that's why we also typically say
78

78

00:04:00,090  -->  00:04:02,960
that Vue uses a declarative approach.
79

79

00:04:02,960  -->  00:04:05,730
We just declare our goal.
80

80

00:04:05,730  -->  00:04:08,600
We don't care about the steps of getting there.
81

81

00:04:08,600  -->  00:04:10,263
Now it's time to practice this.
