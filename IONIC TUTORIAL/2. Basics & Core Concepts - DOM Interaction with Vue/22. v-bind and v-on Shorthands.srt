<v ->So now, it's almost time to practice again,</v>
2

2

00:00:04,350  -->  00:00:07,350
but here's what important shorthand,
3

3

00:00:07,350  -->  00:00:09,390
one way of writing a bit shorter code
4

4

00:00:09,390  -->  00:00:10,980
which you should be aware of.
5

5

00:00:10,980  -->  00:00:14,270
Not directly related to computed properties and watchers,
6

6

00:00:14,270  -->  00:00:16,470
but to view in general.
7

7

00:00:16,470  -->  00:00:18,780
We used v-on quite a bit
8

8

00:00:18,780  -->  00:00:22,390
and before we also used v-bind, if you remember.
9

9

00:00:22,390  -->  00:00:25,490
Now, v-on and v-bind are so common
10

10

00:00:25,490  -->  00:00:28,780
that there are shorthands for them.
11

11

00:00:28,780  -->  00:00:31,980
Instead of using v-on:click, v-on:click,
12

12

00:00:31,980  -->  00:00:34,680
v-on:input and whatever you want to do.
13

13

00:00:34,680  -->  00:00:38,830
You can replace v-on colon, with an at symbol.
14

14

00:00:38,830  -->  00:00:40,580
And that's exactly the same thing.
15

15

00:00:40,580  -->  00:00:43,960
It's just a shorthand provided by view
16

16

00:00:43,960  -->  00:00:46,653
to make adding event listeners a bit easier.
17

17

00:00:47,550  -->  00:00:50,320
You can still combine this with modifiers
18

18

00:00:50,320  -->  00:00:52,820
and still do everything you did before,
19

19

00:00:52,820  -->  00:00:56,660
you just replace v-on colon with @,
20

20

00:00:56,660  -->  00:00:59,290
so that you have less code to write.
21

21

00:00:59,290  -->  00:01:01,630
It's up to you if you want to use that,
22

22

00:01:01,630  -->  00:01:03,720
you just should be consistent.
23

23

00:01:03,720  -->  00:01:08,230
So if you do use it, use it for all events, not just some.
24

24

00:01:08,230  -->  00:01:10,520
And I'm going to use it throughout the course, by the way.
25

25

00:01:10,520  -->  00:01:12,993
But you don't have to, it's just an alternative.
26

26

00:01:13,910  -->  00:01:16,950
We also have a shortcut for v-bind.
27

27

00:01:16,950  -->  00:01:20,730
If we had v-bind:value here,
28

28

00:01:20,730  -->  00:01:24,100
then we can actually also just omit v-bind
29

29

00:01:24,100  -->  00:01:26,430
and just have colon value
30

30

00:01:26,430  -->  00:01:29,230
for binding an attribute dynamically.
31

31

00:01:29,230  -->  00:01:31,780
So just colon, attribute name
32

32

00:01:31,780  -->  00:01:35,230
is a shorthand for v-bind colon attribute name
33

33

00:01:35,230  -->  00:01:40,230
and @event name is a shortcut for a v-on colon event name.
34

34

00:01:41,620  -->  00:01:43,780
Again, it's up to you, what you prefer,
35

35

00:01:43,780  -->  00:01:45,310
but you should be consistent
36

36

00:01:45,310  -->  00:01:48,600
and I'm going to use these shorthands throughout the course.
37

37

00:01:48,600  -->  00:01:51,103
There is no v-model shorthand, by the way.
