1

00:00:02,210  -->  00:00:04,291
<v Maximilian>To output data</v>
2

2

00:00:04,291  -->  00:00:06,870
in your Vue controlled HTML part,
3

3

00:00:06,870  -->  00:00:08,250
there is a special syntax,
4

4

00:00:08,250  -->  00:00:11,270
which is only available in HTML parts
5

5

00:00:11,270  -->  00:00:13,270
that are controlled by Vue,
6

6

00:00:13,270  -->  00:00:16,200
because what Vue will do behind the scenes
7

7

00:00:16,200  -->  00:00:19,780
is it will scan this HTML code
8

8

00:00:19,780  -->  00:00:20,760
you could say,
9

9

00:00:20,760  -->  00:00:22,371
and detect certain features,
10

10

00:00:22,371  -->  00:00:26,170
a certain syntax, which it supports.
11

11

00:00:26,170  -->  00:00:27,770
And the syntax we're going to use here
12

12

00:00:27,770  -->  00:00:31,180
for outputting text, for outputting content
13

13

00:00:31,180  -->  00:00:32,480
in your template,
14

14

00:00:32,480  -->  00:00:33,580
is this one.
15

15

00:00:33,580  -->  00:00:37,270
Double curly braces, opening and closing.
16

16

00:00:37,270  -->  00:00:39,940
By default, if you use that in HTML,
17

17

00:00:39,940  -->  00:00:41,280
this will do nothing.
18

18

00:00:41,280  -->  00:00:43,560
Well, actually you will simply see
19

19

00:00:43,560  -->  00:00:45,660
that on the screen thereafter.
20

20

00:00:45,660  -->  00:00:49,860
If you use the syntax in a Vue controlled HTML snippet,
21

21

00:00:49,860  -->  00:00:51,940
it will do something special,
22

22

00:00:51,940  -->  00:00:56,060
between those opening and closing double curly braces.
23

23

00:00:56,060  -->  00:01:00,950
You can reference your returned data object properties,
24

24

00:01:00,950  -->  00:01:02,400
like course Goal.
25

25

00:01:02,400  -->  00:01:05,320
So, here we can write course Goal,
26

26

00:01:05,320  -->  00:01:07,960
and Vue will make that connection,
27

27

00:01:07,960  -->  00:01:10,170
will understand, that you wanna output
28

28

00:01:10,170  -->  00:01:12,660
the content stored in course Goal here.
29

29

00:01:12,660  -->  00:01:14,630
And it'll do just that.
30

30

00:01:14,630  -->  00:01:17,700
So, if you save this HTML and JavaScript,
31

31

00:01:17,700  -->  00:01:21,310
if both is saved and you reload your webpage,
32

32

00:01:21,310  -->  00:01:25,420
you will see, finish the course and learn Vue here,
33

33

00:01:25,420  -->  00:01:26,323
just like that.
34

34

00:01:27,680  -->  00:01:30,030
And this is pretty amazing, even though of course,
35

35

00:01:30,030  -->  00:01:31,640
it's a very simple app,
36

36

00:01:31,640  -->  00:01:36,340
but keep in mind that this text is stored in JavaScript.
37

37

00:01:36,340  -->  00:01:38,610
Yet, it's rendered on the screen,
38

38

00:01:38,610  -->  00:01:42,200
thanks to Vue and this special syntax.
39

39

00:01:42,200  -->  00:01:46,100
And this syntax here is called interpolation.
40

40

00:01:46,100  -->  00:01:48,870
You don't need to remember this, but that's its name.
41

41

00:01:48,870  -->  00:01:51,290
Interpolation, simply means that in here,
42

42

00:01:51,290  -->  00:01:55,270
you can reference properties, that are part of that object,
43

43

00:01:55,270  -->  00:01:56,900
you return in data,
44

44

00:01:56,900  -->  00:02:00,340
and then the value of the property will be output
45

45

00:02:00,340  -->  00:02:02,310
instead of this part.
46

46

00:02:02,310  -->  00:02:04,050
And Vue automatically detect this
47

47

00:02:04,050  -->  00:02:06,790
and do all that outputting part for you.
48

48

00:02:06,790  -->  00:02:08,680
If you use this syntax.
49

49

00:02:08,680  -->  00:02:10,530
And just to make this really clear,
50

50

00:02:10,530  -->  00:02:13,130
if you would use this anywhere else,
51

51

00:02:13,130  -->  00:02:15,420
let's say here in the header,
52

52

00:02:15,420  -->  00:02:17,529
which is not Vue controlled,
53

53

00:02:17,529  -->  00:02:19,720
you would just see this as text
54

54

00:02:19,720  -->  00:02:21,450
and it would not be replaced
55

55

00:02:21,450  -->  00:02:24,500
because that is really only a Vue feature.
56

56

00:02:24,500  -->  00:02:26,670
This interpolation syntax.
57

57

00:02:26,670  -->  00:02:29,190
And this interpolation syntax is key.
58

58

00:02:29,190  -->  00:02:31,460
We're going to use it a lot, through out the course
59

59

00:02:31,460  -->  00:02:34,330
because it's one of the key features of Vue,
60

60

00:02:34,330  -->  00:02:36,760
which is why I'm getting started with it.
61

61

00:02:36,760  -->  00:02:38,290
It's also worth noting,
62

62

00:02:38,290  -->  00:02:41,950
that you cannot just output text like this,
63

63

00:02:41,950  -->  00:02:43,700
but you could also output a number,
64

64

00:02:43,700  -->  00:02:45,310
if I save that.
65

65

00:02:45,310  -->  00:02:48,110
And you could also output something like true or false,
66

66

00:02:48,110  -->  00:02:49,540
if you want it to.
67

67

00:02:49,540  -->  00:02:51,980
Now if you have an array in there,
68

68

00:02:51,980  -->  00:02:55,250
let's say, you can always output that as we see.
69

69

00:02:55,250  -->  00:02:56,880
So, it's really flexible.
70

70

00:02:56,880  -->  00:02:57,750
You can, for example,
71

71

00:02:57,750  -->  00:02:59,993
also, I'll put an object like this.
72

72

00:03:01,120  -->  00:03:04,090
So, it's really flexible regarding what you can do,
73

73

00:03:04,090  -->  00:03:05,560
but here we want that string.
74

74

00:03:05,560  -->  00:03:07,490
So I'm going to use that.
75

75

00:03:07,490  -->  00:03:11,380
Now that's interpolation and the data property,
76

76

00:03:11,380  -->  00:03:14,510
in the object you use for configuring your app,
77

77

00:03:14,510  -->  00:03:16,390
your Vue app.
78

78

00:03:16,390  -->  00:03:19,390
And this is the first very important takeaway
79

79

00:03:19,390  -->  00:03:21,830
or the first two important takeaways.
80

80

00:03:21,830  -->  00:03:24,240
These are two core features,
81

81

00:03:24,240  -->  00:03:26,090
data and interpolation,
82

82

00:03:26,090  -->  00:03:28,450
which we're going to use throughout the entire course
83

83

00:03:28,450  -->  00:03:30,940
and which you will definitely use
84

84

00:03:30,940  -->  00:03:32,963
in any Vue app you're building.
