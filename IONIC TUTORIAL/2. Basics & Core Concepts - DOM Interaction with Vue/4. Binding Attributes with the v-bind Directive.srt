00:00:02,090  -->  00:00:05,500
<v Instructor>Now we covered two super important features.</v>
2

2

00:00:05,500  -->  00:00:09,220
How we create a Vue instance and configure the data,
3

3

00:00:09,220  -->  00:00:10,410
that we can use there,
4

4

00:00:10,410  -->  00:00:13,480
and how we can output data with interpolation.
5

5

00:00:13,480  -->  00:00:17,350
Now, you don't always want to use interpolation
6

6

00:00:17,350  -->  00:00:18,980
for outputting data, though.
7

7

00:00:18,980  -->  00:00:20,163
Here's an example.
8

8

00:00:21,030  -->  00:00:23,257
Let's say we have a second paragraph, where I say,
9

9

00:00:23,257  -->  00:00:26,800
"learn more about Vue",
10

10

00:00:26,800  -->  00:00:30,120
and I want to make sure that "about Vue" is a link.
11

11

00:00:30,120  -->  00:00:33,370
Of course we can use a anchor tag with the ref attribute
12

12

00:00:33,370  -->  00:00:37,140
for that, and wrap that around "about Vue".
13

13

00:00:37,140  -->  00:00:39,080
If I do that, this is what we get.
14

14

00:00:39,080  -->  00:00:42,193
And now in here, we can pass in our link.
15

15

00:00:43,920  -->  00:00:47,930
Now, just as before, we could absolutely hard code
16

16

00:00:47,930  -->  00:00:51,340
this here in our HTML code,
17

17

00:00:51,340  -->  00:00:56,340
but let's again store the link value in our Vue app instead,
18

18

00:00:57,760  -->  00:01:01,940
and then add some syntax to output the stored value here,
19

19

00:01:01,940  -->  00:01:04,820
simply so that later in the next step, we can make this
20

20

00:01:04,820  -->  00:01:06,700
a bit more dynamic.
21

21

00:01:06,700  -->  00:01:09,330
So for that, I'm going to add a second property
22

22

00:01:09,330  -->  00:01:12,470
to this object which is returned in data,
23

23

00:01:12,470  -->  00:01:13,937
and I'll name it "vueLink".
24

24

00:01:14,860  -->  00:01:18,700
And now this again is a string that can lead to a page
25

25

00:01:18,700  -->  00:01:21,670
where you can learn more about Vue.
26

26

00:01:21,670  -->  00:01:24,950
Now here, I'm simply going to use the official Vue webpage,
27

27

00:01:24,950  -->  00:01:27,940
but again you can of course use anything here.
28

28

00:01:27,940  -->  00:01:31,610
Now, this vueLink property now holds the link
29

29

00:01:31,610  -->  00:01:35,020
that should be output here, and we can of course try
30

30

00:01:35,020  -->  00:01:38,140
to use our curly braces here, just as we did it
31

31

00:01:38,140  -->  00:01:40,530
between the paragraph tags, now I'm doing this
32

32

00:01:40,530  -->  00:01:43,040
on the ref attribute.
33

33

00:01:43,040  -->  00:01:45,520
So here we then point at vueLink,
34

34

00:01:45,520  -->  00:01:49,200
save this, reload, and click "about Vue"
35

35

00:01:49,200  -->  00:01:52,830
as you see, this fails, and, why does it fail,
36

36

00:01:52,830  -->  00:01:54,500
well, let's inspect this
37

37

00:01:54,500  -->  00:01:56,910
with the browser developer tools real quick,
38

38

00:01:56,910  -->  00:01:59,570
I'm using Chrome here, where you can right click something
39

39

00:01:59,570  -->  00:02:02,210
to inspect it, and you will see that
40

40

00:02:02,210  -->  00:02:05,980
the value for the ref attribute
41

41

00:02:05,980  -->  00:02:10,790
is actually the unconverted double curly brace syntax.
42

42

00:02:10,790  -->  00:02:14,090
So clearly Vue did not replace this
43

43

00:02:14,090  -->  00:02:16,950
with the actual value stored in vueLink,
44

44

00:02:16,950  -->  00:02:20,340
as it did it before for this course goal part.
45

45

00:02:20,340  -->  00:02:22,630
Now why did Vue not do that?
46

46

00:02:22,630  -->  00:02:26,580
We are inside of the Vue controlled HTML code.
47

47

00:02:26,580  -->  00:02:28,653
So Vue should detect this.
48

48

00:02:29,730  -->  00:02:31,120
Well, the reason is simple.
49

49

00:02:31,120  -->  00:02:35,440
This double curly brace syntax is only available
50

50

00:02:35,440  -->  00:02:38,600
between opening and closing HTML tags, you could say.
51

51

00:02:38,600  -->  00:02:43,600
So anywhere, where you would, well, output actual content.
52

52

00:02:43,720  -->  00:02:48,070
If you wanna pass in a dynamic value to an attribute,
53

53

00:02:48,070  -->  00:02:52,400
like here, where I wanna set the value of the ref attribute,
54

54

00:02:52,400  -->  00:02:55,590
dynamically with help of Vue, we need to use
55

55

00:02:55,590  -->  00:02:59,260
a different syntax, which thankfully is available though.
56

56

00:02:59,260  -->  00:03:03,120
And that's the Vue binding syntax.
57

57

00:03:03,120  -->  00:03:06,150
For that, we use a so called vue directive,
58

58

00:03:06,150  -->  00:03:08,350
which is simply an extra instruction
59

59

00:03:08,350  -->  00:03:11,070
we add in the HTML code.
60

60

00:03:11,070  -->  00:03:14,760
And we can use such directives on HTML elements,
61

61

00:03:14,760  -->  00:03:17,240
like on this anchor element.
62

62

00:03:17,240  -->  00:03:20,940
The directive we need here is v-bind.
63

63

00:03:20,940  -->  00:03:25,190
V-bind is a reserved name, detected and understood by Vue,
64

64

00:03:25,190  -->  00:03:27,590
and you can tell that it's by Vue
65

65

00:03:27,590  -->  00:03:30,130
because it starts with "v-".
66

66

00:03:30,130  -->  00:03:33,530
All built in directives which ship with Vue,
67

67

00:03:33,530  -->  00:03:36,060
start with "v-", and we're going to see
68

68

00:03:36,060  -->  00:03:38,510
a couple of other ones too throughout the course.
69

69

00:03:39,440  -->  00:03:43,170
Now, what does this v-bind directive do?
70

70

00:03:43,170  -->  00:03:46,660
As I said, a directive is basically an instruction.
71

71

00:03:46,660  -->  00:03:49,970
An instruction we give to Vue to do something.
72

72

00:03:49,970  -->  00:03:54,970
And v-bind tells Vue to bind, so to set,
73

73

00:03:55,150  -->  00:03:57,200
the value of something,
74

74

00:03:57,200  -->  00:03:59,860
and the "of something" part basically just means
75

75

00:03:59,860  -->  00:04:03,580
of an attribute on an HTML element.
76

76

00:04:03,580  -->  00:04:07,880
And to let Vue know which attribute's value to set,
77

77

00:04:07,880  -->  00:04:10,410
we add a colon after v-bind,
78

78

00:04:10,410  -->  00:04:13,240
and then the attribute name, in this case ref,
79

79

00:04:13,240  -->  00:04:16,680
and this is the full syntax which vue will understand,
80

80

00:04:16,680  -->  00:04:21,680
to dynamically set a value of an HTML element attribute,
81

81

00:04:21,760  -->  00:04:23,820
in this case of the ref attribute.
82

82

00:04:23,820  -->  00:04:27,860
This tells Vue, please find, please set
83

83

00:04:27,860  -->  00:04:31,120
the value of the ref attribute to something,
84

84

00:04:31,120  -->  00:04:33,180
and now the "to something" is passed between
85

85

00:04:33,180  -->  00:04:35,550
the opening and closing double quotes here,
86

86

00:04:35,550  -->  00:04:39,620
and here again, you can now reference a value of
87

87

00:04:39,620  -->  00:04:43,660
your data object, so in this case, vueLink for example,
88

88

00:04:43,660  -->  00:04:44,980
just like this.
89

89

00:04:44,980  -->  00:04:48,400
So this here, v-bind, is basically, you could say,
90

90

00:04:48,400  -->  00:04:52,940
the attribute alternative to this interpolation syntax.
91

91

00:04:52,940  -->  00:04:55,880
You use interpolation between HTML tags,
92

92

00:04:55,880  -->  00:04:59,190
and if you need to set the value on an HTML tag,
93

93

00:04:59,190  -->  00:05:01,070
so, to an attribute like this,
94

94

00:05:01,070  -->  00:05:02,640
you use v-bind.
95

95

00:05:02,640  -->  00:05:04,401
If you now save this and reload,
96

96

00:05:04,401  -->  00:05:08,170
we now click this link, I'm taken to the Vue docks.
97

97

00:05:08,170  -->  00:05:11,920
So I'm basically forwarded to the page this link points at.
98

98

00:05:11,920  -->  00:05:15,700
So now this works, and v-bind, just like interpolation,
99

99

00:05:15,700  -->  00:05:18,000
is a key feature you need to know,
100

100

00:05:18,000  -->  00:05:21,070
because typically, you don't just want to output content
101

101

00:05:21,070  -->  00:05:22,980
between opening and closing tags,
102

102

00:05:22,980  -->  00:05:26,310
often you have the scenario that you need to bind,
103

103

00:05:26,310  -->  00:05:30,320
that you need to set the value of some HTML attribute
104

104

00:05:30,320  -->  00:05:34,120
to some Vue managed data, and with v-bind,
105

105

00:05:34,120  -->  00:05:35,703
that's very easy to do.
