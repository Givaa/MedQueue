00:00:02,160  -->  00:00:04,860
<v Instructor>Now that we got the basics about events down,</v>
2

2

00:00:04,860  -->  00:00:07,160
let's talk about event modifiers,
3

3

00:00:07,160  -->  00:00:10,023
which is another useful feature built into Vue.
4

4

00:00:10,960  -->  00:00:13,030
Here's an example for an event modifier
5

5

00:00:13,030  -->  00:00:15,280
that can sometimes be useful.
6

6

00:00:15,280  -->  00:00:18,780
Let's say you had a form HTML element,
7

7

00:00:18,780  -->  00:00:23,780
in there you had some input and you had a button
8

8

00:00:25,550  -->  00:00:27,780
that says, sign up, whatever,
9

9

00:00:27,780  -->  00:00:29,410
if you reload, you have that here.
10

10

00:00:29,410  -->  00:00:31,650
Now the problem you'll have by default,
11

11

00:00:31,650  -->  00:00:33,270
if you leave it like that,
12

12

00:00:33,270  -->  00:00:36,410
even if it's in the Vue controlled HTML part
13

13

00:00:36,410  -->  00:00:39,853
is that when you click this button, this page will reload.
14

14

00:00:41,100  -->  00:00:44,650
And the reason for that is that the browser default
15

15

00:00:44,650  -->  00:00:48,630
for a form with a button like this is to submit that form
16

16

00:00:48,630  -->  00:00:53,630
and send an HTTP request to the server serving this app.
17

17

00:00:53,750  -->  00:00:55,720
In this case we have no such server,
18

18

00:00:55,720  -->  00:00:57,110
we're running this locally,
19

19

00:00:57,110  -->  00:00:59,800
but still the browser simply sends a request
20

20

00:00:59,800  -->  00:01:02,730
to our local machine therefore, you could say.
21

21

00:01:02,730  -->  00:01:05,530
Now, of course, we have no code in place
22

22

00:01:05,530  -->  00:01:07,710
to handle this request.
23

23

00:01:07,710  -->  00:01:11,150
Now we'll get there later in this course,
24

24

00:01:11,150  -->  00:01:14,290
but typically with frameworks like Vue,
25

25

00:01:14,290  -->  00:01:17,510
you wanna prevent this browser default
26

26

00:01:17,510  -->  00:01:21,620
and instead you wanna handle this manually
27

27

00:01:21,620  -->  00:01:25,620
in JavaScript with help of Vue in your Vue app
28

28

00:01:25,620  -->  00:01:29,280
and you wanna read the user input there, validate it
29

29

00:01:29,280  -->  00:01:32,120
and then send it manually to a backend server
30

30

00:01:32,120  -->  00:01:34,440
and store it in a database, for example.
31

31

00:01:34,440  -->  00:01:37,010
So you wanna prevent that browser default
32

32

00:01:37,010  -->  00:01:38,893
of automatically sending it.
33

33

00:01:40,100  -->  00:01:42,120
Now, there are two ways of doing that.
34

34

00:01:42,120  -->  00:01:45,620
One of them is cool and the other one is well more obvious,
35

35

00:01:45,620  -->  00:01:46,810
I would say.
36

36

00:01:46,810  -->  00:01:49,690
You can listen to the submit event here,
37

37

00:01:49,690  -->  00:01:52,250
which again is a default browser event
38

38

00:01:52,250  -->  00:01:55,630
to which you can listen on form elements.
39

39

00:01:55,630  -->  00:01:57,380
Then we could have a method here,
40

40

00:01:57,380  -->  00:02:00,270
submit form like this
41

41

00:02:00,270  -->  00:02:03,900
at which we can point here, submit form.
42

42

00:02:03,900  -->  00:02:06,870
Now we're telling Vue that whenever the form is submitted,
43

43

00:02:06,870  -->  00:02:09,510
submit form should be executed.
44

44

00:02:09,510  -->  00:02:11,270
And here we could do whatever you want.
45

45

00:02:11,270  -->  00:02:13,763
For example, showing alert submitted.
46

46

00:02:14,800  -->  00:02:17,640
Now right now, the problem is that we still have
47

47

00:02:17,640  -->  00:02:18,473
the browser default.
48

48

00:02:18,473  -->  00:02:20,690
If I click this, I get the alert,
49

49

00:02:20,690  -->  00:02:24,130
but the page reloads thereafter, and when the page reloads,
50

50

00:02:24,130  -->  00:02:26,800
that means we lose all our data, right?
51

51

00:02:26,800  -->  00:02:30,320
If I had a counter here and I click sign up,
52

52

00:02:30,320  -->  00:02:32,070
you'll see that all the data is lost
53

53

00:02:32,070  -->  00:02:35,630
because of the page reload, the Vue app restarts
54

54

00:02:35,630  -->  00:02:36,630
so to say.
55

55

00:02:36,630  -->  00:02:39,440
So we haven't solved the problem,
56

56

00:02:39,440  -->  00:02:43,330
but remember that we get this default event object,
57

57

00:02:43,330  -->  00:02:46,060
I talked about that in the last lecture.
58

58

00:02:46,060  -->  00:02:49,320
Now we can call prevent default on that.
59

59

00:02:49,320  -->  00:02:52,190
This is a default browser mechanism,
60

60

00:02:52,190  -->  00:02:53,880
it's built in JavaScript,
61

61

00:02:53,880  -->  00:02:56,810
which is totally independent from Vue.
62

62

00:02:56,810  -->  00:03:00,130
Even if we just used Vanilla JavaScript
63

63

00:03:00,130  -->  00:03:02,640
on that default event object, which we get,
64

64

00:03:02,640  -->  00:03:04,663
we could call prevent default.
65

65

00:03:05,545  -->  00:03:07,210
And this would tell the browser that the form
66

66

00:03:07,210  -->  00:03:08,890
should not be submitted,
67

67

00:03:08,890  -->  00:03:11,383
that we don't want that browser default.
68

68

00:03:12,220  -->  00:03:15,340
So now if I reload, I can change my counter,
69

69

00:03:15,340  -->  00:03:18,990
click sign up, we see the alert and the counter still
70

70

00:03:18,990  -->  00:03:21,740
is there because now that browser default
71

71

00:03:21,740  -->  00:03:23,073
has been prevented.
72

72

00:03:24,190  -->  00:03:27,330
This works and there's nothing wrong with it,
73

73

00:03:27,330  -->  00:03:30,920
but Vue has a nicer way for us.
74

74

00:03:30,920  -->  00:03:32,690
We can remove all that code
75

75

00:03:32,690  -->  00:03:37,010
and instead use a so-called event modifier.
76

76

00:03:37,010  -->  00:03:40,160
There are certain built in modifiers,
77

77

00:03:40,160  -->  00:03:44,633
which you can connect to events you're listening to,
78

78

00:03:44,633  -->  00:03:46,740
let's say to change that event behavior,
79

79

00:03:46,740  -->  00:03:51,740
and you add such a modifier with a dot after the event name
80

80

00:03:52,160  -->  00:03:53,810
after v-on.
81

81

00:03:53,810  -->  00:03:57,710
So v-on: then the event name and then a dot
82

82

00:03:57,710  -->  00:03:59,910
if you want the modifier.
83

83

00:03:59,910  -->  00:04:03,110
Now, there are only a couple of supported modifiers.
84

84

00:04:03,110  -->  00:04:05,840
You can find a full list in the official docs.
85

85

00:04:05,840  -->  00:04:10,350
For example, there is a prevent modifier and this modifier,
86

86

00:04:10,350  -->  00:04:14,680
which is built into Vue will prevent the browser default.
87

87

00:04:14,680  -->  00:04:19,210
So it will basically do what we did manually a second ago
88

88

00:04:19,210  -->  00:04:20,943
just with less code.
89

89

00:04:21,820  -->  00:04:25,830
There always is a stop modifier for stopping propagation,
90

90

00:04:25,830  -->  00:04:28,850
but here we need to prevent modifier.
91

91

00:04:28,850  -->  00:04:32,490
And with data, if you reload, I can sign up.
92

92

00:04:32,490  -->  00:04:35,600
We see that alert and still the page doesn't reload,
93

93

00:04:35,600  -->  00:04:38,240
thanks to this modifier.
94

94

00:04:38,240  -->  00:04:42,440
So that's nice to know, and that will come in handy later.
95

95

00:04:42,440  -->  00:04:44,770
We don't just have such event modifiers
96

96

00:04:44,770  -->  00:04:47,590
to change the event and browser behavior,
97

97

00:04:47,590  -->  00:04:51,340
we also have modifiers we can connect to events
98

98

00:04:51,340  -->  00:04:54,460
to change when the event occurs.
99

99

00:04:54,460  -->  00:04:56,790
And one example would be our buttons.
100

100

00:04:56,790  -->  00:04:59,440
Let's say for whatever reason,
101

101

00:04:59,440  -->  00:05:03,480
we only wanna subtract five if the user right clicks
102

102

00:05:03,480  -->  00:05:04,800
on the button.
103

103

00:05:04,800  -->  00:05:08,670
The default of course is to react to a left click.
104

104

00:05:08,670  -->  00:05:10,750
But if you want it to react to a right click,
105

105

00:05:10,750  -->  00:05:13,480
we could add a modifier here as well.
106

106

00:05:13,480  -->  00:05:15,513
And we can set it to right.
107

107

00:05:16,400  -->  00:05:20,110
Alternative values are left, which you don't need to specify
108

108

00:05:20,110  -->  00:05:24,470
because it's the default, middle and well, right.
109

109

00:05:24,470  -->  00:05:26,830
And this tells Vue that here,
110

110

00:05:26,830  -->  00:05:30,220
you only wanna react to a right click.
111

111

00:05:30,220  -->  00:05:32,700
So when you're using a mouse event like click,
112

112

00:05:32,700  -->  00:05:36,230
you can use the right, left and middle event modifiers
113

113

00:05:36,230  -->  00:05:40,223
to change which mouse button triggers this event.
114

114

00:05:41,210  -->  00:05:42,710
So if we now save this, you see,
115

115

00:05:42,710  -->  00:05:45,660
I can add 10 by clicking with the left key
116

116

00:05:45,660  -->  00:05:47,520
but if I click on subtract five
117

117

00:05:47,520  -->  00:05:49,740
with the left key, nothing happens.
118

118

00:05:49,740  -->  00:05:52,150
If I use the right mouse button, though,
119

119

00:05:52,150  -->  00:05:53,800
which you can tell I'm doing,
120

120

00:05:53,800  -->  00:05:56,100
because my context menu opens up,
121

121

00:05:56,100  -->  00:05:58,610
now the counter gets smaller.
122

122

00:05:58,610  -->  00:06:01,920
Of course we can argue whether that's useful here,
123

123

00:06:01,920  -->  00:06:06,220
but it's definitely useful to be aware of those modifiers.
124

124

00:06:06,220  -->  00:06:08,860
And there's a last kind of modifiers.
125

125

00:06:08,860  -->  00:06:11,000
And that would be key modifiers
126

126

00:06:11,000  -->  00:06:13,610
when you're listening to keyboard events
127

127

00:06:13,610  -->  00:06:15,890
like here on the input element.
128

128

00:06:15,890  -->  00:06:19,440
Currently we're updating the name upon the input event here,
129

129

00:06:19,440  -->  00:06:21,370
so on every keystroke.
130

130

00:06:21,370  -->  00:06:26,180
Now let's say we wanna update the internally stored name
131

131

00:06:26,180  -->  00:06:29,950
sold as name property with every keystroke,
132

132

00:06:29,950  -->  00:06:34,480
but the name that's being output here should only be updated
133

133

00:06:34,480  -->  00:06:39,480
when the user hits enter on this input element.
134

134

00:06:40,710  -->  00:06:43,800
Well, for that, we could have another data property
135

135

00:06:43,800  -->  00:06:47,540
confirmed name, which is the actual name
136

136

00:06:47,540  -->  00:06:49,420
we wanna output here.
137

137

00:06:49,420  -->  00:06:54,420
So here we got the confirmed name in this paragraph
138

138

00:06:55,570  -->  00:06:59,960
and the confirmed name, unlike the internally stored name,
139

139

00:06:59,960  -->  00:07:01,810
which is just named name,
140

140

00:07:01,810  -->  00:07:04,930
the confirmed name should only update here
141

141

00:07:04,930  -->  00:07:08,283
when the user hits the enter button in this input field.
142

142

00:07:09,140  -->  00:07:13,190
For that, we can add another event listener
143

143

00:07:13,190  -->  00:07:14,720
on the input element.
144

144

00:07:14,720  -->  00:07:16,600
Yes, you can have more than one.
145

145

00:07:16,600  -->  00:07:20,370
So here we are listening to input with v-on input.
146

146

00:07:20,370  -->  00:07:24,040
Now I'll add another v-on directive and also listen
147

147

00:07:24,040  -->  00:07:27,140
to the key up event,
148

148

00:07:27,140  -->  00:07:31,080
which is triggered when a key is pressed and released again.
149

149

00:07:31,080  -->  00:07:35,480
And here, I wanna trigger a method which I have yet to add,
150

150

00:07:35,480  -->  00:07:39,730
which I'll call confirm input or confirm name,
151

151

00:07:39,730  -->  00:07:41,520
whatever you want.
152

152

00:07:41,520  -->  00:07:44,160
The goal here in confirm input
153

153

00:07:44,160  -->  00:07:47,960
is to set this confirmed name,
154

154

00:07:47,960  -->  00:07:50,640
so this new data property we added,
155

155

00:07:50,640  -->  00:07:52,920
which we're outputting in this paragraph,
156

156

00:07:52,920  -->  00:07:57,450
set this confirmed name equal to the internally stored name,
157

157

00:07:57,450  -->  00:07:59,633
which we update with every keystroke.
158

158

00:08:01,640  -->  00:08:06,640
So here v-on key up, I wanna point at confirm input.
159

159

00:08:08,270  -->  00:08:10,910
Now currently this would fire whenever
160

160

00:08:10,910  -->  00:08:13,790
any key is pressed and released.
161

161

00:08:13,790  -->  00:08:17,480
So currently, if I reload here, we would basically have
162

162

00:08:17,480  -->  00:08:21,440
the same behavior as before with every keystroke
163

163

00:08:21,440  -->  00:08:25,220
the input event but then also the key up event is triggered
164

164

00:08:25,220  -->  00:08:27,440
and therefore we basically confirm the input
165

165

00:08:27,440  -->  00:08:28,593
with every keystroke.
166

166

00:08:29,690  -->  00:08:33,620
So that's probably not the final behavior we want.
167

167

00:08:33,620  -->  00:08:37,260
Instead, we can use another modifier with a dot here
168

168

00:08:37,260  -->  00:08:40,750
to tell Vue that since this is a keyboard event,
169

169

00:08:40,750  -->  00:08:42,410
we only wanna react,
170

170

00:08:42,410  -->  00:08:46,990
we only wanna trigger this event upon certain special keys
171

171

00:08:46,990  -->  00:08:49,160
that are pressed and released.
172

172

00:08:49,160  -->  00:08:51,620
For example, the enter key,
173

173

00:08:51,620  -->  00:08:56,070
you could also listen to control or shift or page down,
174

174

00:08:56,070  -->  00:08:58,720
all keyboard keys are possible here,
175

175

00:08:58,720  -->  00:09:01,163
but I wanna listen to the enter key.
176

176

00:09:02,010  -->  00:09:05,140
And with that, I'm saying, hey, when the enter key
177

177

00:09:05,140  -->  00:09:07,040
is pressed and released,
178

178

00:09:07,040  -->  00:09:09,923
then confirm input should be executed.
179

179

00:09:10,850  -->  00:09:13,570
So now if I save that and reload,
180

180

00:09:13,570  -->  00:09:18,570
I can enter Maximilian here and we see nothing in that
181

181

00:09:18,770  -->  00:09:23,770
green box, but if I placed my cursor in here and hit enter,
182

182

00:09:24,010  -->  00:09:25,893
now we see that output here.
183

183

00:09:27,460  -->  00:09:30,370
So these are event modifiers.
184

184

00:09:30,370  -->  00:09:33,570
Now I'm quickly going to auto format this HTML code
185

185

00:09:33,570  -->  00:09:36,940
with the format document key combination here
186

186

00:09:36,940  -->  00:09:39,460
in Visual Studio Code to make this more readable,
187

187

00:09:39,460  -->  00:09:40,770
but it's the same code as before
188

188

00:09:40,770  -->  00:09:42,530
just structured differently.
189

189

00:09:42,530  -->  00:09:44,560
So that's the input we just worked on,
190

190

00:09:44,560  -->  00:09:46,880
we have the input event and the key up event
191

191

00:09:46,880  -->  00:09:49,890
with the enter modifier to change when
192

192

00:09:49,890  -->  00:09:51,763
confirm input executes.
