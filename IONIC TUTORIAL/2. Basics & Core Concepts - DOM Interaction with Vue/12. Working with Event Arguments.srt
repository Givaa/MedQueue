00:00:02,160  -->  00:00:04,950
<v Instructor>Okay. So we learned quite a bit about events.</v>
2

2

00:00:04,950  -->  00:00:09,950
What if we now don't just want to add one and subtract one,
3

3

00:00:10,080  -->  00:00:14,280
but we want to be able to add five and reduce this by five?
4

4

00:00:14,280  -->  00:00:17,430
Maybe name it Subtract therefore, whatever you want.
5

5

00:00:17,430  -->  00:00:21,060
But the goal is that we now don't just add and deduct one,
6

6

00:00:21,060  -->  00:00:23,663
but instead five, how would we do that?
7

7

00:00:24,990  -->  00:00:26,990
Well, we of course,
8

8

00:00:26,990  -->  00:00:31,630
could accept a parameter in those methods, right?
9

9

00:00:31,630  -->  00:00:34,760
That is how we would probably do it in JavaScript.
10

10

00:00:34,760  -->  00:00:39,610
We can accept a parameter, number, or number, or n,
11

11

00:00:39,610  -->  00:00:40,690
totally up to you,
12

12

00:00:40,690  -->  00:00:43,653
it's your method so you can accept whatever you want.
13

13

00:00:44,560  -->  00:00:49,560
And then we could add num here or reduce num.
14

14

00:00:49,710  -->  00:00:52,860
Of course, we could also make this less dynamic
15

15

00:00:52,860  -->  00:00:55,170
and just hard-code five here.
16

16

00:00:55,170  -->  00:00:58,410
The problem just is that whenever we plan to
17

17

00:00:58,410  -->  00:01:01,930
change this number, we need to change it down there in code.
18

18

00:01:01,930  -->  00:01:04,250
So it typically would be better
19

19

00:01:04,250  -->  00:01:06,580
to have a more dynamic method,
20

20

00:01:06,580  -->  00:01:10,740
which gets the number which we wanna add or remove,
21

21

00:01:10,740  -->  00:01:14,140
and then uses this as a parameter like this.
22

22

00:01:14,140  -->  00:01:17,880
Then these methods will never need to be changed
23

23

00:01:17,880  -->  00:01:22,300
when we decide to deduct or add a different number.
24

24

00:01:22,300  -->  00:01:24,270
So that's the more generic and therefore,
25

25

00:01:24,270  -->  00:01:26,793
typically better way of writing these methods.
26

26

00:01:27,940  -->  00:01:30,760
But how do we tell Vue that it should call
27

27

00:01:30,760  -->  00:01:34,780
add and reduce with a value of five
28

28

00:01:34,780  -->  00:01:37,310
for these parameters?
29

29

00:01:37,310  -->  00:01:38,710
Well, keep in mind,
30

30

00:01:38,710  -->  00:01:42,650
we can execute add like this by pointing at it
31

31

00:01:42,650  -->  00:01:45,290
or by calling it explicitly.
32

32

00:01:45,290  -->  00:01:49,840
Well, and if we called it like this, we're as a developer,
33

33

00:01:49,840  -->  00:01:53,280
in full control over the value we wanna pass
34

34

00:01:53,280  -->  00:01:55,930
to the parameters of these methods.
35

35

00:01:55,930  -->  00:01:58,420
So here we can add five for example,
36

36

00:01:58,420  -->  00:02:01,680
and reduce by five, just like that.
37

37

00:02:01,680  -->  00:02:04,670
And now whenever we decide to go for a new value,
38

38

00:02:04,670  -->  00:02:08,360
we just have to change it here in HTML,
39

39

00:02:08,360  -->  00:02:12,098
where we're changing the caption of the button anyways,
40

40

00:02:12,098  -->  00:02:15,200
and the method will work correctly automatically
41

41

00:02:15,200  -->  00:02:17,733
because it's written in a very generic way.
42

42

00:02:19,490  -->  00:02:21,610
So if we now save that and reload,
43

43

00:02:21,610  -->  00:02:26,610
I can add 10 and subtract five and it just works.
44

44

00:02:27,060  -->  00:02:31,880
So passing arguments to methods is also possible,
45

45

00:02:31,880  -->  00:02:33,300
and it's very easy to do,
46

46

00:02:33,300  -->  00:02:35,490
and this is an important pattern to know.
47

47

00:02:35,490  -->  00:02:39,560
This is important to understand, because in reality,
48

48

00:02:39,560  -->  00:02:41,870
in apps you're building with Vue,
49

49

00:02:41,870  -->  00:02:43,840
you will sometimes have the scenario
50

50

00:02:43,840  -->  00:02:46,430
that your method needs to get some parameter,
51

51

00:02:46,430  -->  00:02:48,520
which you as a developer want to set,
52

52

00:02:48,520  -->  00:02:51,610
and as you see, setting it and telling Vue
53

53

00:02:51,610  -->  00:02:56,610
to call this method with this value is super, super easy.
