00:00:02,209  -->  00:00:03,320
<v ->[Maximilian Schwarzmuller] So now we know how to</v>
2

2

00:00:03,320  -->  00:00:04,500
output data.
3

3

00:00:04,500  -->  00:00:06,290
In modern web applications,
4

4

00:00:06,290  -->  00:00:08,560
that's only half of what you do though.
5

5

00:00:08,560  -->  00:00:11,020
You also need to react to user input.
6

6

00:00:11,020  -->  00:00:12,810
You need to react to events.
7

7

00:00:12,810  -->  00:00:15,260
You wanna make dynamic pages.
8

8

00:00:15,260  -->  00:00:18,290
After all, this is one of the main reasons for using
9

9

00:00:18,290  -->  00:00:19,760
a framework like Vue.
10

10

00:00:19,760  -->  00:00:22,810
It makes building highly reactive and dynamic,
11

11

00:00:22,810  -->  00:00:24,743
web applications easier.
12

12

00:00:25,700  -->  00:00:28,470
Therefore, that's what we're going to focus on next,
13

13

00:00:28,470  -->  00:00:31,220
and attached you'll find a simple starting project,
14

14

00:00:31,220  -->  00:00:34,040
which is not too different from the one before.
15

15

00:00:34,040  -->  00:00:36,730
We just have a slightly different content.
16

16

00:00:36,730  -->  00:00:39,350
Still got a section with a different ID now,
17

17

00:00:39,350  -->  00:00:43,510
and in there we've got two buttons, add and remove.
18

18

00:00:43,510  -->  00:00:47,130
We also have a paragraph, where I output a counter,
19

19

00:00:47,130  -->  00:00:49,290
which is managed in his Vue app,
20

20

00:00:49,290  -->  00:00:51,940
which is created for you already.
21

21

00:00:51,940  -->  00:00:55,020
It's a very simple Vue app here, as you can tell,
22

22

00:00:55,020  -->  00:00:57,500
pretty empty, just has to state a method,
23

23

00:00:57,500  -->  00:00:59,260
where I returned my data,
24

24

00:00:59,260  -->  00:01:01,570
which only consists of a counter in the end,
25

25

00:01:01,570  -->  00:01:03,480
which is a number, starting at zero.
26

26

00:01:03,480  -->  00:01:06,720
And then mount this to the events section,
27

27

00:01:06,720  -->  00:01:10,490
which is this section that holds all that markup.
28

28

00:01:10,490  -->  00:01:12,810
Now at the moment, those buttons don't do anything.
29

29

00:01:12,810  -->  00:01:16,210
If I press them, you'll see that well, nothing happens.
30

30

00:01:16,210  -->  00:01:18,610
And that's exactly what we wanna work on.
31

31

00:01:18,610  -->  00:01:21,400
I wanna show you how you can react to user input,
32

32

00:01:21,400  -->  00:01:24,520
and how you now can really leverage Vue,
33

33

00:01:24,520  -->  00:01:28,940
to make a more interactive and reactive web application.
34

34

00:01:28,940  -->  00:01:31,670
Let's say, when this button, the add button,
35

35

00:01:31,670  -->  00:01:33,220
when this button is pressed,
36

36

00:01:33,220  -->  00:01:35,937
we wanna add one, to the counter.
37

37

00:01:35,937  -->  00:01:40,040
And the remove button, or reduce maybe.
38

38

00:01:40,040  -->  00:01:42,040
When the reduce button, is pressed,
39

39

00:01:42,040  -->  00:01:45,720
we wanna deduct one from the counter.
40

40

00:01:45,720  -->  00:01:48,650
Let's start with the add button, how could we do that?
41

41

00:01:48,650  -->  00:01:51,050
In regular JavaScript,
42

42

00:01:51,050  -->  00:01:55,710
we would get access to the button with document,
43

43

00:01:55,710  -->  00:01:57,100
get element by ID.
44

44

00:01:57,100  -->  00:02:00,710
If that button had an ID or with query selector,
45

45

00:02:00,710  -->  00:02:03,190
and selecting the first button we find,
46

46

00:02:03,190  -->  00:02:05,080
and we could add an EventListener,
47

47

00:02:05,080  -->  00:02:07,070
with the addEventListener method.
48

48

00:02:07,070  -->  00:02:09,430
That is how we would do it,
49

49

00:02:09,430  -->  00:02:13,140
in the vanilla JavaScript, without Vue.
50

50

00:02:13,140  -->  00:02:14,410
But we're using Vue,
51

51

00:02:14,410  -->  00:02:16,530
so that we don't have to do it like this,
52

52

00:02:16,530  -->  00:02:20,310
so that we don't have to, define step by step,
53

53

00:02:20,310  -->  00:02:23,370
what should happen, but that we instead can leverage,
54

54

00:02:23,370  -->  00:02:26,850
this declarative approach, and just declare,
55

55

00:02:26,850  -->  00:02:31,110
our end result and let Vue figure out how to get there.
56

56

00:02:31,110  -->  00:02:32,810
And therefore, thankfully,
57

57

00:02:32,810  -->  00:02:36,455
Vue gives us an easier way of adding EventListeners,
58

58

00:02:36,455  -->  00:02:38,720
to HTML elements.
59

59

00:02:38,720  -->  00:02:41,730
If we wanna add a click listener to this button,
60

60

00:02:41,730  -->  00:02:44,660
we can use a never Vue directive.
61

61

00:02:44,660  -->  00:02:46,540
We learned about V-bind.
62

62

00:02:46,540  -->  00:02:51,250
V-bind is helpful for setting the value of an attribute.
63

63

00:02:51,250  -->  00:02:52,990
Now for adding EventListeners,
64

64

00:02:52,990  -->  00:02:56,720
we have another directive, and that's the V-on directive,
65

65

00:02:56,720  -->  00:03:00,003
because we wanna react on, a certain event.
66

66

00:03:00,910  -->  00:03:05,420
V-on takes a so-called argument, after a colon,
67

67

00:03:05,420  -->  00:03:08,970
just like V-bind, took the attribute,
68

68

00:03:08,970  -->  00:03:10,330
which should be bound.
69

69

00:03:10,330  -->  00:03:13,390
V-on takes the event to which you wanna listen,
70

70

00:03:13,390  -->  00:03:14,730
after the colon.
71

71

00:03:14,730  -->  00:03:16,023
In this case, click.
72

72

00:03:17,310  -->  00:03:20,120
Now in case you're wondering to which events you can listen.
73

73

00:03:20,120  -->  00:03:22,950
Well, all the default events you can listen to
74

74

00:03:22,950  -->  00:03:25,010
on HTML elements.
75

75

00:03:25,010  -->  00:03:29,670
So that would be click, mouseenter, mouseleave,
76

76

00:03:29,670  -->  00:03:31,650
really anything you can listen to
77

77

00:03:31,650  -->  00:03:33,570
in vanilla JavaScript as well.
78

78

00:03:33,570  -->  00:03:36,210
Here, it's the click to which I wanna listen.
79

79

00:03:36,210  -->  00:03:38,170
And then after an equal sign,
80

80

00:03:38,170  -->  00:03:40,900
between the opening and closing double quotes,
81

81

00:03:40,900  -->  00:03:43,660
we now specify the code that should run,
82

82

00:03:43,660  -->  00:03:45,210
when the click occurs.
83

83

00:03:45,210  -->  00:03:47,580
And that could be counter plus, plus,
84

84

00:03:47,580  -->  00:03:50,560
which is the shortest form of writing and JavaScript,
85

85

00:03:50,560  -->  00:03:53,090
that we wanna to add one, to the counter.
86

86

00:03:53,090  -->  00:03:57,520
And that's just JavaScript code, nothing Vue specific.
87

87

00:03:57,520  -->  00:04:00,660
As with V-bind at the double curly braces,
88

88

00:04:00,660  -->  00:04:03,149
you can have simple JavaScript expressions,
89

89

00:04:03,149  -->  00:04:06,320
right here in your HTML code,
90

90

00:04:06,320  -->  00:04:08,920
in the parts that are managed by Vue.
91

91

00:04:08,920  -->  00:04:11,170
Like here with V-on.
92

92

00:04:11,170  -->  00:04:14,310
If I now save that in reload, I can click add,
93

93

00:04:14,310  -->  00:04:17,270
and you will see that the counter, gets bigger,
94

94

00:04:17,270  -->  00:04:20,910
every time I clicked this button, thanks to this code.
95

95

00:04:20,910  -->  00:04:23,410
Now try doing, well, basically the same,
96

96

00:04:23,410  -->  00:04:26,693
just with reducing the counter, on this button.
97

97

00:04:28,520  -->  00:04:29,860
Were you successful.
98

98

00:04:29,860  -->  00:04:31,930
Well, of course it shouldn't be too difficult,
99

99

00:04:31,930  -->  00:04:33,670
it's essentially the same code.
100

100

00:04:33,670  -->  00:04:37,140
We wanna react to a click event, with V-on click.
101

101

00:04:37,140  -->  00:04:41,010
And then here, we just have counter minus, minus,
102

102

00:04:41,010  -->  00:04:44,140
or the longer form would also work of course.
103

103

00:04:44,140  -->  00:04:46,140
It's totally up to you, what you write there.
104

104

00:04:46,140  -->  00:04:48,440
With that you can also reduce the counter.
105

105

00:04:48,440  -->  00:04:51,070
So now we can add, and reduce.
106

106

00:04:51,070  -->  00:04:53,310
And that's pretty, pretty nice.
107

107

00:04:53,310  -->  00:04:58,050
And this is, how we can listen to user events in Vue.
108

108

00:04:58,050  -->  00:05:00,070
And here's one super important thing,
109

109

00:05:00,070  -->  00:05:01,490
which is easy to overlook,
110

110

00:05:01,490  -->  00:05:06,490
which shows us why, we use Vue, and how powerful Vue is.
111

111

00:05:07,890  -->  00:05:10,830
You might notice that we don't have much code here,
112

112

00:05:10,830  -->  00:05:15,600
some HTML code, and definitely not a lot of JavaScript code.
113

113

00:05:15,600  -->  00:05:19,860
I mean, this here is all the JavaScript code we wrote.
114

114

00:05:19,860  -->  00:05:23,710
Yet, we have two EventListeners, and a counter that changes,
115

115

00:05:23,710  -->  00:05:27,200
and most importantly, and easy to overlook,
116

116

00:05:27,200  -->  00:05:29,620
we got a counter that's being output here,
117

117

00:05:29,620  -->  00:05:32,890
where the page the users sees,
118

118

00:05:32,890  -->  00:05:35,700
changes every time the counter changes.
119

119

00:05:35,700  -->  00:05:39,150
This minus six here, changes to a minus five,
120

120

00:05:39,150  -->  00:05:40,370
if I click the button,
121

121

00:05:40,370  -->  00:05:43,810
and that's not something which would normally happen
122

122

00:05:43,810  -->  00:05:44,740
in a webpage.
123

123

00:05:44,740  -->  00:05:47,660
You would need to write JavaScript code,
124

124

00:05:47,660  -->  00:05:50,790
that adds EventListeners, changes the counter.
125

125

00:05:50,790  -->  00:05:52,930
And then when the counter changes,
126

126

00:05:52,930  -->  00:05:55,120
reaches out to that paragraph,
127

127

00:05:55,120  -->  00:05:58,110
to change the value that's showing up there.
128

128

00:05:58,110  -->  00:06:01,860
And that's exactly what Vue does behind the scenes for you.
129

129

00:06:01,860  -->  00:06:06,190
That is the core asset of frameworks like Vue.
130

130

00:06:06,190  -->  00:06:10,820
You just declare, where you wanna have EventListeners,
131

131

00:06:10,820  -->  00:06:13,210
and where you wanna output values,
132

132

00:06:13,210  -->  00:06:15,910
and which values you should be aware of.
133

133

00:06:15,910  -->  00:06:18,720
And Vue us all the rest of adding
134

134

00:06:18,720  -->  00:06:20,910
and managing those listeners,
135

135

00:06:20,910  -->  00:06:23,110
updating the counter behind the scenes.
136

136

00:06:23,110  -->  00:06:24,741
And most importantly,
137

137

00:06:24,741  -->  00:06:27,800
detecting when the counter changes,
138

138

00:06:27,800  -->  00:06:31,670
and updating the parts of the real rendered page,
139

139

00:06:31,670  -->  00:06:33,740
where updating is needed,
140

140

00:06:33,740  -->  00:06:35,600
when that counter changes.
141

141

00:06:35,600  -->  00:06:37,840
This is what Vue does behind the scenes.
142

142

00:06:37,840  -->  00:06:39,100
This is a,
143

143

00:06:39,100  -->  00:06:41,100
core feature of Vue.
144

144

00:06:41,100  -->  00:06:43,380
This built in reactivity,
145

145

00:06:43,380  -->  00:06:46,510
it detects that the counter changes,
146

146

00:06:46,510  -->  00:06:50,400
when you click a button, and it's then finds the places,
147

147

00:06:50,400  -->  00:06:52,980
on the page where the counter is used,
148

148

00:06:52,980  -->  00:06:55,440
to update what the user sees,
149

149

00:06:55,440  -->  00:06:58,690
with JavaScript behind the scenes.
150

150

00:06:58,690  -->  00:07:00,110
I'm really emphasizing this
151

151

00:07:00,110  -->  00:07:02,933
because it's so important to understand what Vue does here,
152

152

00:07:02,933  -->  00:07:05,740
and hopefully why that's pretty amazing,
153

153

00:07:05,740  -->  00:07:10,540
and makes our life, as a developer, much, much easier.
154

154

00:07:10,540  -->  00:07:13,320
Well, and that's how we can get started with events in Vue.
155
