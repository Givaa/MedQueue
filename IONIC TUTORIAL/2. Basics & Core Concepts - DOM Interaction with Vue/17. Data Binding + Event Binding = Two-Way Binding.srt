00:00:02,130  -->  00:00:05,820
<v Narrator>So back in the project worked on before.</v>
2

2

00:00:05,820  -->  00:00:08,920
A bit simplified, I dumped the event modifiers,
3

3

00:00:08,920  -->  00:00:12,500
I dumped v-ons and you find this snapshot attached
4

4

00:00:12,500  -->  00:00:15,360
to this lecture in case you all don't want to start from,
5

5

00:00:15,360  -->  00:00:17,700
well, this state again.
6

6

00:00:17,700  -->  00:00:19,290
So I'm back in this project
7

7

00:00:19,290  -->  00:00:21,900
where we have this input element that the buttons
8

8

00:00:21,900  -->  00:00:23,933
for the counter and so on.
9

9

00:00:25,070  -->  00:00:29,670
Now let's say our goal is to have another button
10

10

00:00:29,670  -->  00:00:33,740
maybe here below the input where we say resetInput.
11

11

00:00:34,760  -->  00:00:36,930
And the buttons should do what the name implies.
12

12

00:00:36,930  -->  00:00:41,223
It should reset the input in, well, the input element.
13

13

00:00:42,420  -->  00:00:45,360
For that, we can add a new method,
14

14

00:00:45,360  -->  00:00:48,710
resetInput, or however you wanna name it.
15

15

00:00:48,710  -->  00:00:52,690
And in there, how do we do that?
16

16

00:00:52,690  -->  00:00:56,400
In there we now want to be clear this input.
17

17

00:00:56,400  -->  00:00:59,700
Now we could try to get access to the input
18

18

00:00:59,700  -->  00:01:04,700
through JavaScript with document.querySelector, for example,
19

19

00:01:05,660  -->  00:01:07,680
get access to the input like this,
20

20

00:01:07,680  -->  00:01:11,453
access to value property and set it to an empty string.
21

21

00:01:12,440  -->  00:01:16,440
This might actually work, but it's very hacky.
22

22

00:01:16,440  -->  00:01:19,990
We're not using Vue to then fall back
23

23

00:01:19,990  -->  00:01:22,980
to such explicit JavaScript instructions.
24

24

00:01:22,980  -->  00:01:25,650
That's not the idea behind using Vue.
25

25

00:01:25,650  -->  00:01:27,670
Instead, we wanna stay in the Vue world
26

26

00:01:27,670  -->  00:01:30,553
and leverage Vue and its features for that.
27

27

00:01:31,390  -->  00:01:33,640
So how could we do that?
28

28

00:01:33,640  -->  00:01:38,640
Well, we could use the name, data property,
29

29

00:01:40,340  -->  00:01:43,260
which is the value we're ultimately updating
30

30

00:01:43,260  -->  00:01:44,970
on every key stroke.
31

31

00:01:44,970  -->  00:01:49,750
And output it here in input by setting value,
32

32

00:01:49,750  -->  00:01:53,260
the value attribute equal to name, however, not like this,
33

33

00:01:53,260  -->  00:01:57,390
but instead since name is dynamic and managed by Vue
34

34

00:01:57,390  -->  00:01:59,273
with help of v-bind.
35

35

00:02:00,280  -->  00:02:05,280
With that I'm making sure that name is reflected here.
36

36

00:02:05,740  -->  00:02:08,900
So this name here is reflected in the input.
37

37

00:02:08,900  -->  00:02:10,660
Why am I doing that?
38

38

00:02:10,660  -->  00:02:14,020
Well if I now go to resetInput
39

39

00:02:14,020  -->  00:02:17,050
and set this name equal to an empty string,
40

40

00:02:17,050  -->  00:02:21,010
that empty value should be reflected in the input
41

41

00:02:21,010  -->  00:02:25,000
and we should be able to set it back to an empty string.
42

42

00:02:25,000  -->  00:02:27,110
Now we'll have one problem with that.
43

43

00:02:27,110  -->  00:02:29,970
And that is that in set name,
44

44

00:02:29,970  -->  00:02:32,900
I'm not setting name to just what the user enters,
45

45

00:02:32,900  -->  00:02:36,980
but to what the user enters plus the last name.
46

46

00:02:36,980  -->  00:02:39,530
And that would lead to a strange behavior
47

47

00:02:39,530  -->  00:02:42,590
if we then reflect name back into this input here,
48

48

00:02:42,590  -->  00:02:44,050
I can actually show it to you.
49

49

00:02:44,050  -->  00:02:48,010
If I reload you'll see if I start typing
50

50

00:02:48,010  -->  00:02:50,850
Schwartzmueller gets added over and over again,
51

51

00:02:50,850  -->  00:02:52,690
which is not the idea.
52

52

00:02:52,690  -->  00:02:55,960
So for the moment, let's get rid of this last name,
53

53

00:02:55,960  -->  00:02:57,400
which we add here.
54

54

00:02:57,400  -->  00:03:00,250
And let's just store what the user enters
55

55

00:03:00,250  -->  00:03:02,680
with every keystroke in name,
56

56

00:03:02,680  -->  00:03:05,700
and then reflect named back into the input
57

57

00:03:05,700  -->  00:03:09,230
so that there we really reflect what the user entered.
58

58

00:03:09,230  -->  00:03:14,040
And now let's also connect this button here with v-on:click
59

59

00:03:15,009  -->  00:03:19,010
to this newly added resetInput method
60

60

00:03:19,010  -->  00:03:20,240
so that this is triggered
61

61

00:03:20,240  -->  00:03:22,890
when the resetInput button is pressed.
62

62

00:03:22,890  -->  00:03:24,630
And with that, if I now reload,
63

63

00:03:24,630  -->  00:03:27,400
I can enter Max here and it all works.
64

64

00:03:27,400  -->  00:03:30,950
But if I click resetInput, we cleared it.
65

65

00:03:30,950  -->  00:03:33,210
We also cleared in the paragraph
66

66

00:03:33,210  -->  00:03:36,580
because there we're referring to the same name,
67

67

00:03:36,580  -->  00:03:38,390
which we reset here,
68

68

00:03:38,390  -->  00:03:40,660
but that's just a little side effect here.
69

69

00:03:40,660  -->  00:03:42,790
Of course if you wanted to prevent that,
70

70

00:03:42,790  -->  00:03:45,510
we could use a separate value, which would be output here,
71

71

00:03:45,510  -->  00:03:49,200
which be confirmed upon hitting enter or anything like that.
72

72

00:03:49,200  -->  00:03:53,200
I showed this before, how we could work with two values,
73

73

00:03:53,200  -->  00:03:55,430
confirmed input and irregular input,
74

74

00:03:55,430  -->  00:03:57,760
but that's not what this is about.
75

75

00:03:57,760  -->  00:04:00,920
Instead, what this is about is about the fact that
76

76

00:04:00,920  -->  00:04:03,970
this is a pattern you could need in some occasions.
77

77

00:04:03,970  -->  00:04:07,460
You might have inputs where you don't just want
78

78

00:04:07,460  -->  00:04:10,220
to get the value the user entered,
79

79

00:04:10,220  -->  00:04:14,170
but where you also want to set the value
80

80

00:04:14,170  -->  00:04:16,790
of the input so that you, for example,
81

81

00:04:16,790  -->  00:04:19,990
can reset it with a button or any other logic
82

82

00:04:19,990  -->  00:04:22,130
you have on your page.
83

83

00:04:22,130  -->  00:04:24,030
And you can then achieve this
84

84

00:04:24,030  -->  00:04:26,220
by not just listening to the input,
85

85

00:04:26,220  -->  00:04:30,790
but by also sending the stored value back into the input
86

86

00:04:30,790  -->  00:04:32,900
by binding the value property.
87

87

00:04:32,900  -->  00:04:35,690
This is a common pattern you could need.
88

88

00:04:35,690  -->  00:04:37,840
And actually it's so common
89

89

00:04:37,840  -->  00:04:39,560
that you need something like this
90

90

00:04:39,560  -->  00:04:43,220
that Vue has a shortcut for this you could say.
91

91

00:04:43,220  -->  00:04:47,360
It has a special built in directive which simplifies this.
92

92

00:04:47,360  -->  00:04:52,360
If you bind the value and listen to input changes on input,
93

93

00:04:53,440  -->  00:04:56,270
you can get rid of all of that.
94

94

00:04:56,270  -->  00:05:00,520
So both of the value binding and the input event listening,
95

95

00:05:00,520  -->  00:05:04,760
get rid of both and instead add a new directive
96

96

00:05:04,760  -->  00:05:08,670
on the input, the v-model directive.
97

97

00:05:08,670  -->  00:05:12,950
And this v-model directive now simply wants
98

98

00:05:12,950  -->  00:05:16,690
the data property it should manage for you,
99

99

00:05:16,690  -->  00:05:19,780
so in our case, the name property.
100

100

00:05:19,780  -->  00:05:23,220
The name property now is managed by Vue
101

101

00:05:23,220  -->  00:05:27,180
such that it's updated on the input event
102

102

00:05:27,180  -->  00:05:30,710
and the name properties value is then sent back
103

103

00:05:30,710  -->  00:05:32,290
into the input element.
104

104

00:05:32,290  -->  00:05:37,290
So v-model is simply just a shortcut for v-bind value
105

105

00:05:38,450  -->  00:05:40,310
and v-on input,
106

106

00:05:40,310  -->  00:05:42,637
v-model is just a shortcut for this.
107

107

00:05:42,637  -->  00:05:44,480
And if I now save that and reload,
108

108

00:05:44,480  -->  00:05:46,850
we therefore get the same behavior as before
109

109

00:05:47,810  -->  00:05:49,590
but with less code.
110

110

00:05:49,590  -->  00:05:52,980
And this is a concept called two-way binding
111

111

00:05:52,980  -->  00:05:55,760
because we're communicating in both ways,
112

112

00:05:55,760  -->  00:05:58,610
we are listening to an event coming
113

113

00:05:58,610  -->  00:06:02,170
out of the input element you could say to the input event.
114

114

00:06:02,170  -->  00:06:06,050
And at the same time, we're writing the value back
115

115

00:06:06,050  -->  00:06:09,750
to the input element through its value attribute,
116

116

00:06:09,750  -->  00:06:11,900
through its value property.
117

117

00:06:11,900  -->  00:06:13,710
That's why it's called two-way binding
118

118

00:06:13,710  -->  00:06:16,630
because we communicate in both directions.
119

119

00:06:16,630  -->  00:06:18,120
And this is useful,
120

120

00:06:18,120  -->  00:06:21,480
it makes getting user input and updating it
121

121

00:06:21,480  -->  00:06:23,170
much easier as you can tell,
122

122

00:06:23,170  -->  00:06:25,760
it's less code and therefore absolutely
123

123

00:06:25,760  -->  00:06:29,280
a pattern and specifically a directive
124

124

00:06:29,280  -->  00:06:30,480
you should keep in mind.
