00:00:02,710  -->  00:00:05,150
<v ->So now we know how to build our Vue app,</v>
2

2

00:00:05,150  -->  00:00:08,100
how to output content or bind attributes.
3

3

00:00:08,100  -->  00:00:11,880
And then we can either set up some data in data
4

4

00:00:11,880  -->  00:00:15,005
and refer to that in our HTML code,
5

5

00:00:15,005  -->  00:00:18,033
or then we can also define methods which are called.
6

6

00:00:19,640  -->  00:00:21,440
It really depends on what you're building
7

7

00:00:21,440  -->  00:00:23,923
and what your application goal is in the end.
8

8

00:00:24,870  -->  00:00:27,794
Now, before we practice those first important concepts,
9

9

00:00:27,794  -->  00:00:31,240
there are a couple of other things you should know about
10

10

00:00:31,240  -->  00:00:34,200
Vue and how to work with its data.
11

11

00:00:34,200  -->  00:00:37,010
For example, let's say we have our courseGoals
12

12

00:00:37,010  -->  00:00:39,350
stored in data properties.
13

13

00:00:39,350  -->  00:00:42,160
We've got our coarseGoalA here,
14

14

00:00:42,160  -->  00:00:44,930
and we got our coarseGoalB here,
15

15

00:00:44,930  -->  00:00:48,680
Master Vue and build amazing apps.
16

16

00:00:48,680  -->  00:00:51,530
So, we got our two different goals here now.
17

17

00:00:51,530  -->  00:00:54,890
And instead of returning hardcoded strings here
18

18

00:00:54,890  -->  00:00:59,220
in outputGoal, I wanna output one of these two Goals,
19

19

00:00:59,220  -->  00:01:01,560
which are defined in data.
20

20

00:01:01,560  -->  00:01:03,380
This is very easy to do in Vue,
21

21

00:01:03,380  -->  00:01:06,790
but it uses a special feature or a syntax,
22

22

00:01:06,790  -->  00:01:08,940
which you should be aware of.
23

23

00:01:08,940  -->  00:01:11,220
Let's say here, if the random number
24

24

00:01:11,220  -->  00:01:15,843
is smaller than dot five, I wanna return courseGoalA.
25

25

00:01:16,860  -->  00:01:20,570
Now we can't just write courseGoalA here.
26

26

00:01:20,570  -->  00:01:23,210
This would not be valid JavaScript.
27

27

00:01:23,210  -->  00:01:25,870
With this code, JavaScript would look for
28

28

00:01:25,870  -->  00:01:29,568
a courseGoalA variable or constant, which it wouldn't find
29

29

00:01:29,568  -->  00:01:33,870
because here courseGoalA is not a variable or constant,
30

30

00:01:33,870  -->  00:01:35,793
it's a property of this object.
31

31

00:01:37,200  -->  00:01:38,780
But instead we can use a syntax,
32

32

00:01:38,780  -->  00:01:42,830
which you probably wouldn't think that it works.
33

33

00:01:42,830  -->  00:01:45,313
You can use this.courseGoalA.
34

34

00:01:46,230  -->  00:01:49,270
Now, depending on your level of JavaScript knowledge,
35

35

00:01:49,270  -->  00:01:51,390
this might look very strange.
36

36

00:01:51,390  -->  00:01:54,960
The this keyword is a core keyword in JavaScript,
37

37

00:01:54,960  -->  00:01:58,030
and it can be tricky, but in this context,
38

38

00:01:58,030  -->  00:02:02,260
this should not refer to this object here.
39

39

00:02:02,260  -->  00:02:04,040
It should refer to something else.
40

40

00:02:04,040  -->  00:02:09,040
And it normally would, but Vue does some magic here.
41

41

00:02:09,240  -->  00:02:12,820
It basically takes all the data you return
42

42

00:02:12,820  -->  00:02:16,738
in this data object, which you return the data method,
43

43

00:02:16,738  -->  00:02:21,738
and it merges it into a global Vue instance object.
44

44

00:02:22,500  -->  00:02:25,743
So into your Vue app object, you could say.
45

45

00:02:27,470  -->  00:02:30,810
So, these three data properties are available
46

46

00:02:30,810  -->  00:02:34,453
in a behind the scenes managed Vue app object.
47

47

00:02:35,300  -->  00:02:38,760
Your methods are also available there.
48

48

00:02:38,760  -->  00:02:41,550
And they do have access to anything stored
49

49

00:02:41,550  -->  00:02:45,250
in that global object through the this keyword.
50

50

00:02:45,250  -->  00:02:49,920
And that's why in this custom method inside of methods,
51

51

00:02:49,920  -->  00:02:54,263
we can use this to refer for example, to our data.
52

52

00:02:55,220  -->  00:02:59,163
So, we can do this here as well, this.courseGoalB.
53

53

00:03:01,636  -->  00:03:02,980
And if I saved it and reload,
54

54

00:03:02,980  -->  00:03:05,910
we therefore now output these different course goals,
55

55

00:03:05,910  -->  00:03:09,593
which are stored in our data with help of this method.
56

56

00:03:10,810  -->  00:03:13,520
And having that knowledge of the this keyword
57

57

00:03:13,520  -->  00:03:16,150
and what it refers to inside of your methods
58

58

00:03:16,150  -->  00:03:18,380
in your Vue app, that's important,
59

59

00:03:18,380  -->  00:03:20,310
because we're going to work with that a lot
60

60

00:03:20,310  -->  00:03:21,460
throughout this course.
