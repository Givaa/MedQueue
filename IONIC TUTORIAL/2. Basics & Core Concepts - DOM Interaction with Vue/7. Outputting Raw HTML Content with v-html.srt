<v ->So at this point,</v>
2

2

00:00:03,400  -->  00:00:07,780
the good news is that we covered almost all important
3

3

00:00:07,780  -->  00:00:10,687
features and functionalities that are related to
4

4

00:00:10,687  -->  00:00:12,210
outputting data,
5

5

00:00:12,210  -->  00:00:16,270
namely interpolation and the v-bind directive.
6

6

00:00:16,270  -->  00:00:19,030
Also combined with the knowledge that you can output either
7

7

00:00:19,030  -->  00:00:23,693
data or the result of method calls like we're doing it here.
8

8

00:00:25,430  -->  00:00:27,580
Now there is one more feature,
9

9

00:00:27,580  -->  00:00:30,350
one more directive you should be aware of.
10

10

00:00:30,350  -->  00:00:32,280
Let's say one of the two goals,
11

11

00:00:32,280  -->  00:00:33,900
let's say course goal B
12

12

00:00:33,900  -->  00:00:36,940
is actually not just a simple string like this,
13

13

00:00:36,940  -->  00:00:39,540
but this is some HTML code.
14

14

00:00:39,540  -->  00:00:40,700
And this could be a scenario
15

15

00:00:40,700  -->  00:00:42,202
you have in application.
16

16

00:00:42,202  -->  00:00:43,617
Where you, for example,
17

17

00:00:43,617  -->  00:00:46,970
fetched a data and it should be output from a database
18

18

00:00:46,970  -->  00:00:50,373
and from there you're getting some structured HTML code.
19

19

00:00:51,470  -->  00:00:54,870
Now if you use HTML elements in this string,
20

20

00:00:54,870  -->  00:00:58,010
and you output this with interpolation.
21

21

00:00:58,010  -->  00:01:00,260
So with the double curly braces,
22

22

00:01:00,260  -->  00:01:05,200
you'll see that the HTML elements are just output as text.
23

23

00:01:05,200  -->  00:01:08,800
So they are not interpreted as HTML.
24

24

00:01:08,800  -->  00:01:12,020
And that actually is a useful security feature because it
25

25

00:01:12,020  -->  00:01:14,890
protects you against cross site scripting attacks.
26

26

00:01:14,890  -->  00:01:16,123
So this is good.
27

27

00:01:17,490  -->  00:01:21,210
But sometimes you want to output this as HTML
28

28

00:01:21,210  -->  00:01:24,160
and not as text that looks like HTML.
29

29

00:01:24,160  -->  00:01:26,490
And for that you've got another directive you can use.
30

30

00:01:26,490  -->  00:01:30,070
And that is the v-html directive.
31

31

00:01:30,070  -->  00:01:31,760
We saw v-bind before.
32

32

00:01:31,760  -->  00:01:34,070
V-bind can be used to bind,
33

33

00:01:34,070  -->  00:01:37,090
so to set the values of attributes.
34

34

00:01:37,090  -->  00:01:38,295
With v-html,
35

35

00:01:38,295  -->  00:01:41,737
you set the content between opening and closing text
36

36

00:01:41,737  -->  00:01:42,857
of an element,
37

37

00:01:42,857  -->  00:01:44,703
but you now tell Vue
38

38

00:01:44,703  -->  00:01:48,620
that the content should be interpreted as HTML.
39

39

00:01:48,620  -->  00:01:50,241
So it should not be output as text
40

40

00:01:50,241  -->  00:01:53,520
as it is with double curly braces.
41

41

00:01:53,520  -->  00:01:56,760
And therefore you no longer use double curly braces here,
42

42

00:01:56,760  -->  00:02:00,150
but instead, the value you pass to v-html
43

43

00:02:00,150  -->  00:02:02,920
between the double quotes here
44

44

00:02:02,920  -->  00:02:06,030
would be coarse goal B for example,
45

45

00:02:06,030  -->  00:02:08,020
or also if you want it to,
46

46

00:02:08,020  -->  00:02:10,520
the result of calling output goal.
47

47

00:02:10,520  -->  00:02:12,480
This also works.
48

48

00:02:12,480  -->  00:02:14,070
And if I now reload,
49

49

00:02:14,070  -->  00:02:15,610
you see from time to time,
50

50

00:02:15,610  -->  00:02:17,863
there's this dh2 tag.
51

51

00:02:17,863  -->  00:02:19,550
The text is just green,
52

52

00:02:19,550  -->  00:02:21,960
which is why you don't see it because of my styling,
53

53

00:02:21,960  -->  00:02:25,300
but this now is interpreted as HTML.
54

54

00:02:25,300  -->  00:02:28,470
And of course goal A is also interpreted as HTML,
55

55

00:02:28,470  -->  00:02:31,560
but in there I got no HTML text.
56

56

00:02:31,560  -->  00:02:33,940
So this is a feature you can use.
57

57

00:02:33,940  -->  00:02:35,404
I'm going to comment it out here,
58

58

00:02:35,404  -->  00:02:37,290
because we don't need it here,
59

59

00:02:37,290  -->  00:02:39,160
but I wanted to make you aware of it.
60

60

00:02:39,160  -->  00:02:41,770
If you get some contents stored in your Vue app,
61

61

00:02:41,770  -->  00:02:46,770
which contains HTML code, that should be treated as HTML.
62

62

00:02:47,400  -->  00:02:50,620
The v-html directive, which is built into Vue
63

63

00:02:50,620  -->  00:02:52,260
will help you with that.
64

64

00:02:52,260  -->  00:02:55,440
Now chances are, you'll not need it too often,
65

65

00:02:55,440  -->  00:02:58,500
and you should definitely not use it as a default.
66

66

00:02:58,500  -->  00:03:01,970
Because you can introduce security issues with that
67

67

00:03:01,970  -->  00:03:04,530
because you basically circumvent the built in
68

68

00:03:04,530  -->  00:03:06,760
cross site scripting attack protection
69

69

00:03:06,760  -->  00:03:09,080
you have with the double curly braces.
70

70

00:03:09,080  -->  00:03:10,490
But if you know what you're doing,
71

71

00:03:10,490  -->  00:03:13,500
and you need to output something as HTML,
72

72

00:03:13,500  -->  00:03:16,940
the v-html directive is your friend.
73

73

00:03:16,940  -->  00:03:17,773
Well,
74

74

00:03:17,773  -->  00:03:20,880
and these are some basics about working with the Vue app
75

75

00:03:20,880  -->  00:03:23,480
and outputting content with data,
76

76

00:03:23,480  -->  00:03:25,700
or with a method which you call.
77

77

00:03:25,700  -->  00:03:26,880
And therefore I'd say,
78

78

00:03:26,880  -->  00:03:29,500
next it's time to practice the subject.
