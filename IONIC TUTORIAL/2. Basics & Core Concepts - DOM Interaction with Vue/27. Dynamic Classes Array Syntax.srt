00:00:02,090  -->  00:00:04,940
<v Maximilian>There's one more syntax supported by Vue</v>
2

2

00:00:04,940  -->  00:00:07,060
which I don't want to hide from you.
3

3

00:00:07,060  -->  00:00:11,290
You can have multiple class attributes like this,
4

4

00:00:11,290  -->  00:00:14,340
but if you have multiple class assignments,
5

5

00:00:14,340  -->  00:00:18,720
you can also just work with one dynamic class assignment
6

6

00:00:18,720  -->  00:00:21,780
where you, for example, have this object syntax,
7

7

00:00:21,780  -->  00:00:24,160
but not passing the object like this,
8

8

00:00:24,160  -->  00:00:28,490
but instead pass an array where your object,
9

9

00:00:28,490  -->  00:00:32,070
where you configure which class should be added,
10

10

00:00:32,070  -->  00:00:34,880
could be one element in the array.
11

11

00:00:34,880  -->  00:00:39,510
And other elements could be, for example, demo as a string.
12

12

00:00:39,510  -->  00:00:41,120
So with that, you can also add
13

13

00:00:41,120  -->  00:00:45,050
multiple potentially dynamically derived classes
14

14

00:00:45,050  -->  00:00:49,100
to one at the same div by using this array syntax,
15

15

00:00:49,100  -->  00:00:50,880
which also works just fine.
16

16

00:00:50,880  -->  00:00:53,710
That's just a number of syntax to be aware of.
17

17

00:00:53,710  -->  00:00:55,620
You have multiple options here,
18

18

00:00:55,620  -->  00:00:58,660
and it of course depends on your personal preferences
19

19

00:00:58,660  -->  00:01:00,510
and also on what you're building,
20

20

00:01:00,510  -->  00:01:03,280
which option you want to go with,
21

21

00:01:03,280  -->  00:01:05,030
but that is dynamic styling
22

22

00:01:05,030  -->  00:01:07,890
and what you can do regarding that in Vue.
23

23

00:01:07,890  -->  00:01:10,890
Obviously super powerful and super important
24

24

00:01:10,890  -->  00:01:12,960
as you will all see throughout this course
25

25

00:01:12,960  -->  00:01:15,180
and the different projects we're going to build
26

26

00:01:15,180  -->  00:01:17,120
because with dynamic styling,
27

27

00:01:17,120  -->  00:01:20,033
you can really build amazing user interfaces.
