00:00:02,170  -->  00:00:03,590
<v Instructor>So now at this point,</v>
2

2

00:00:03,590  -->  00:00:05,870
we know a couple of things.
3

3

00:00:05,870  -->  00:00:08,770
We learned about DOM interaction,
4

4

00:00:08,770  -->  00:00:11,470
and that's a complex term with that I mean
5

5

00:00:11,470  -->  00:00:14,770
that we learned how to make a part of the DOM,
6

6

00:00:14,770  -->  00:00:19,530
the template of our Vue app by mounting the Vue app to it.
7

7

00:00:19,530  -->  00:00:21,200
We learned about data binding,
8

8

00:00:21,200  -->  00:00:26,080
with the bind and string interpolation, and also v-HTML,
9

9

00:00:26,080  -->  00:00:28,810
and we learned about event handling with v-on,
10

10

00:00:28,810  -->  00:00:31,470
but also with v-model.
11

11

00:00:31,470  -->  00:00:34,820
To be precise, v-model is two-way binding,
12

12

00:00:34,820  -->  00:00:37,240
and therefore the combination of data binding
13

13

00:00:37,240  -->  00:00:39,620
and event handling so to say.
14

14

00:00:39,620  -->  00:00:42,260
Now, it's time to dive into a third,
15

15

00:00:42,260  -->  00:00:44,620
big block that makes up Vue.
16

16

00:00:44,620  -->  00:00:46,690
This block has no official name,
17

17

00:00:46,690  -->  00:00:50,750
but I like to call it advanced reactivity.
18

18

00:00:50,750  -->  00:00:53,110
Vue is very reactive,
19

19

00:00:53,110  -->  00:00:55,780
we already see that in a lot of places.
20

20

00:00:55,780  -->  00:00:58,930
When I type here, the name here updates,
21

21

00:00:58,930  -->  00:01:00,700
and Vue does that for us.
22

22

00:01:00,700  -->  00:01:04,223
The same if we change the counter, so that all works.
23

23

00:01:05,080  -->  00:01:06,870
But we have even more features
24

24

00:01:06,870  -->  00:01:09,380
than what we know about thus far.
25

25

00:01:09,380  -->  00:01:12,770
And I wanna start by coming back to methods
26

26

00:01:12,770  -->  00:01:15,210
besides using them with events,
27

27

00:01:15,210  -->  00:01:18,890
and then show you a better alternative to methods
28

28

00:01:18,890  -->  00:01:20,513
for certain use cases.
29

29

00:01:21,490  -->  00:01:24,840
Now, in this app here, we add it to a binding,
30

30

00:01:24,840  -->  00:01:29,800
but to add it, we had to get rid of our last name here.
31

31

00:01:29,800  -->  00:01:31,410
Now, that's not too bad
32

32

00:01:31,410  -->  00:01:34,720
because the way we made the entered name,
33

33

00:01:34,720  -->  00:01:39,660
a full name by adding a last name wasn't ideal anyways,
34

34

00:01:39,660  -->  00:01:43,730
using this setName method, passing in this argument,
35

35

00:01:43,730  -->  00:01:47,470
it worked but as you see, as soon as you want to do more,
36

36

00:01:47,470  -->  00:01:50,470
for example, adding a reset functionality,
37

37

00:01:50,470  -->  00:01:53,920
it's pretty hard to implement it like this,
38

38

00:01:53,920  -->  00:01:56,200
that's why we had to get rid of it.
39

39

00:01:56,200  -->  00:02:00,680
But that's no problem, we can output a full name here,
40

40

00:02:00,680  -->  00:02:02,630
in a different way.
41

41

00:02:02,630  -->  00:02:04,920
For example, we can add a new method,
42

42

00:02:04,920  -->  00:02:07,080
anywhere where you want` by the way,
43

43

00:02:07,080  -->  00:02:10,180
the order of methods here does not play a role.
44

44

00:02:10,180  -->  00:02:12,470
So I will add it at the top.
45

45

00:02:12,470  -->  00:02:15,257
And we'll name it, outputFullname,
46

46

00:02:18,100  -->  00:02:20,860
because that's what this method should do.
47

47

00:02:20,860  -->  00:02:25,090
It should return something, because I'm not going to use it
48

48

00:02:25,090  -->  00:02:26,970
to bind it to an event,
49

49

00:02:26,970  -->  00:02:31,230
but instead I'm going to use it to call it here,
50

50

00:02:31,230  -->  00:02:32,500
in the curly braces,
51

51

00:02:32,500  -->  00:02:35,793
I wanna call outputFullname, like this.
52

52

00:02:36,680  -->  00:02:39,560
And therefore I wanna get back to full name here,
53

53

00:02:39,560  -->  00:02:44,530
which then will be inserted in this part of the HTML code.
54

54

00:02:44,530  -->  00:02:47,400
And therefore here I wanna return this name,
55

55

00:02:47,400  -->  00:02:49,060
which is the entered name,
56

56

00:02:49,060  -->  00:02:52,723
so this name property, which we're managing with v-model,
57

57

00:02:53,930  -->  00:02:58,683
plus a blank space, plus Schwarzmuller,
58

58

00:03:00,070  -->  00:03:03,270
and of course this Schwarzmuller could also be fetched
59

59

00:03:03,270  -->  00:03:06,463
from another input, here it's simply hard-coded.
60

60

00:03:07,640  -->  00:03:09,920
And if it's now saved and then reload,
61

61

00:03:09,920  -->  00:03:12,380
we see Schwarzmuller here at the beginning,
62

62

00:03:12,380  -->  00:03:14,460
and if I enter Maximilian,
63

63

00:03:14,460  -->  00:03:16,960
we see Maximilian Schwarzmuller.
64

64

00:03:16,960  -->  00:03:20,030
Now since I'm using a method we can even add an if check
65

65

00:03:20,030  -->  00:03:24,823
and check if this name is currently empty,
66

66

00:03:26,850  -->  00:03:30,230
and if it is empty we just return an empty string here,
67

67

00:03:30,230  -->  00:03:35,230
so that we only add Schwarzmuller if the name is not empty.
68

68

00:03:35,440  -->  00:03:37,480
So here we leveraged the fact
69

69

00:03:37,480  -->  00:03:41,250
that we're having a method to return different values based
70

70

00:03:41,250  -->  00:03:43,400
on different values and name.
71

71

00:03:43,400  -->  00:03:46,020
And with that if I saved as a reload,
72

72

00:03:46,020  -->  00:03:48,940
we make sure that we initially don't see anything,
73

73

00:03:48,940  -->  00:03:52,860
and we only see full name with Schwarzmuller included
74

74

00:03:52,860  -->  00:03:55,020
if I did enter a real name,
75

75

00:03:55,020  -->  00:03:58,373
and as soon as that's empty again, the full name is gone.
76

76

00:03:59,280  -->  00:04:00,780
So that's pretty nice,
77

77

00:04:00,780  -->  00:04:03,307
however, it's not the best way of doing that.
78

78

00:04:03,307  -->  00:04:06,530
"Now why is that not the best way of doing it?"
79

79

00:04:06,530  -->  00:04:10,090
Well, if I type here we update the name
80

80

00:04:10,090  -->  00:04:12,180
and output down there, that's good.
81

81

00:04:12,180  -->  00:04:16,000
The problem is if I press this counter button,
82

82

00:04:16,000  -->  00:04:17,950
we don't see a problem,
83

83

00:04:17,950  -->  00:04:20,650
but behind the scenes Vue does something,
84

84

00:04:20,650  -->  00:04:22,940
which is not ideal.
85

85

00:04:22,940  -->  00:04:25,130
When we change the counter,
86

86

00:04:25,130  -->  00:04:28,530
Vue basically tries to find out,
87

87

00:04:28,530  -->  00:04:33,530
where on this page, it needs to update the rendered page.
88

88

00:04:35,000  -->  00:04:38,360
So for example, if the counter changes Vue sees
89

89

00:04:38,360  -->  00:04:40,920
that in this paragraph we're using to counter
90

90

00:04:40,920  -->  00:04:45,020
and hence it needs to well update this part here
91

91

00:04:45,020  -->  00:04:48,580
on the real page, that's exactly why we use Vue,
92

92

00:04:48,580  -->  00:04:51,870
it updates the page for us automatically.
93

93

00:04:51,870  -->  00:04:56,010
The problem is if we call a method like this here,
94

94

00:04:56,010  -->  00:05:01,010
this method will also be re-executed by Vue,
95

95

00:05:01,040  -->  00:05:04,320
whenever anything on the page changes,
96

96

00:05:04,320  -->  00:05:08,520
because Vue can't know what this method does.
97

97

00:05:08,520  -->  00:05:10,200
It doesn't know wherever,
98

98

00:05:10,200  -->  00:05:13,460
maybe the counter gets used in there.
99

99

00:05:13,460  -->  00:05:15,230
Well, if the counter changed,
100

100

00:05:15,230  -->  00:05:17,770
and this method maybe uses the counter
101

101

00:05:17,770  -->  00:05:21,140
this method should be re-executed, right?
102

102

00:05:21,140  -->  00:05:24,490
Well, and for that reason Vue goes ahead,
103

103

00:05:24,490  -->  00:05:27,640
and re-executes any method
104

104

00:05:27,640  -->  00:05:30,570
you're using anywhere in your HTML code
105

105

00:05:31,480  -->  00:05:36,130
between curly braces, or with the bind, or with the HTML,
106

106

00:05:36,130  -->  00:05:40,740
so any non-event bound method will be re-executed by Vue,
107

107

00:05:40,740  -->  00:05:43,390
whenever anything on the screen changes.
108

108

00:05:43,390  -->  00:05:47,300
Even if like in this case, we know that in this method,
109

109

00:05:47,300  -->  00:05:48,690
we're not using the counter.
110

110

00:05:48,690  -->  00:05:51,060
We know it, but Vue doesn't.
111

111

00:05:51,060  -->  00:05:54,620
And from a performance perspective, that's not so great.
112

112

00:05:54,620  -->  00:05:56,110
And we can see this by the way,
113

113

00:05:56,110  -->  00:06:00,033
we can add a console log here running again,
114

114

00:06:02,210  -->  00:06:05,970
and if I now, increase this a little bit,
115

115

00:06:05,970  -->  00:06:07,860
open up the browser developer tools,
116

116

00:06:07,860  -->  00:06:10,750
and go to the JavaScript console part,
117

117

00:06:10,750  -->  00:06:13,160
you will see that if I reload here,
118

118

00:06:13,160  -->  00:06:15,800
we see running again initially,
119

119

00:06:15,800  -->  00:06:18,920
but if I change to counter, we also see it running again,
120

120

00:06:18,920  -->  00:06:21,330
being executed over and over again,
121

121

00:06:21,330  -->  00:06:24,080
even though we just changed to counter.
122

122

00:06:24,080  -->  00:06:26,910
Still outputFullname was executed again,
123

123

00:06:26,910  -->  00:06:29,423
for the reasons I just specified.
124

124

00:06:31,230  -->  00:06:33,310
And that's not a back, that's how Vue works.
125

125

00:06:33,310  -->  00:06:37,710
And that's why methods are not the best solution
126

126

00:06:37,710  -->  00:06:42,240
for outputting some dynamically calculated value like this,
127

127

00:06:42,240  -->  00:06:44,113
but what is a better solution then?
