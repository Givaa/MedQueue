00:00:02,140  -->  00:00:03,700
<v ->Now, since it is a huge course,</v>
2

2

00:00:03,700  -->  00:00:06,870
I want to ensure that you get the most out of this course.
3

3

00:00:06,870  -->  00:00:10,060
And for that, I've got a couple of tips and tricks.
4

4

00:00:10,060  -->  00:00:12,890
Obviously I recommend that you watch the videos.
5

5

00:00:12,890  -->  00:00:15,890
It's a video-on-demand course, after all.
6

6

00:00:15,890  -->  00:00:17,170
Watch them at your pace,
7

7

00:00:17,170  -->  00:00:20,120
and use the video player controls to speed me up,
8

8

00:00:20,120  -->  00:00:22,510
if I'm going too slow or slow me down,
9

9

00:00:22,510  -->  00:00:24,240
if I'm going too fast.
10

10

00:00:24,240  -->  00:00:27,660
In addition, I always recommend that you code along.
11

11

00:00:27,660  -->  00:00:29,380
Try things on your own,
12

12

00:00:29,380  -->  00:00:33,080
and maybe pause the video and try writing the code,
13

13

00:00:33,080  -->  00:00:36,070
for what we're about to add on your own.
14

14

00:00:36,070  -->  00:00:37,590
And even if you don't do that,
15

15

00:00:37,590  -->  00:00:39,250
pause the video from time to time,
16

16

00:00:39,250  -->  00:00:42,060
to catch up with me to code along,
17

17

00:00:42,060  -->  00:00:44,543
or as I just said, also code ahead.
18

18

00:00:45,520  -->  00:00:47,910
You might also need to repeat certain concepts
19

19

00:00:47,910  -->  00:00:49,020
from time to time.
20

20

00:00:49,020  -->  00:00:50,970
This is totally normal.
21

21

00:00:50,970  -->  00:00:52,950
It's a lot of content in this course,
22

22

00:00:52,950  -->  00:00:54,890
and therefore definitely feel free,
23

23

00:00:54,890  -->  00:00:57,940
to repeat videos or entire sections,
24

24

00:00:57,940  -->  00:00:59,600
if something is unclear,
25

25

00:00:59,600  -->  00:01:02,640
or you forgot about a certain concept.
26

26

00:01:02,640  -->  00:01:05,050
With the big course projects we have,
27

27

00:01:05,050  -->  00:01:06,340
throughout this course, though,
28

28

00:01:06,340  -->  00:01:08,610
you will also often get a chance of seeing
29

29

00:01:08,610  -->  00:01:09,915
all the concepts you learn,
30

30

00:01:09,915  -->  00:01:12,400
coming together in one project though.
31

31

00:01:12,400  -->  00:01:15,430
So that will also help with understanding these concepts,
32

32

00:01:15,430  -->  00:01:17,193
and seeing how they work together.
33

33

00:01:18,250  -->  00:01:20,800
Now, of course, sometimes you might also get stuck.
34

34

00:01:20,800  -->  00:01:22,370
You might face an error,
35

35

00:01:22,370  -->  00:01:24,410
or something might be unclear.
36

36

00:01:24,410  -->  00:01:28,690
Two sources I recommend that you consider in such cases,
37

37

00:01:28,690  -->  00:01:31,440
would be Google and stack overflow.
38

38

00:01:31,440  -->  00:01:34,920
You will find stack overflow automatically if you Google.
39

39

00:01:34,920  -->  00:01:36,740
And I'm serious about this,
40

40

00:01:36,740  -->  00:01:38,730
if you face some error message,
41

41

00:01:38,730  -->  00:01:40,410
if something is unclear,
42

42

00:01:40,410  -->  00:01:42,930
put it into Google and search the web,
43

43

00:01:42,930  -->  00:01:45,450
often you'll find a couple of threads,
44

44

00:01:45,450  -->  00:01:47,310
on that problem specifically.
45

45

00:01:47,310  -->  00:01:51,210
And very often that will help you solve your problem.
46

46

00:01:51,210  -->  00:01:53,680
But of course, if you don't find a solution there,
47

47

00:01:53,680  -->  00:01:55,940
or if you are stuck, if something is unclear,
48

48

00:01:55,940  -->  00:01:58,020
we also got a Q and A section,
49

49

00:01:58,020  -->  00:02:00,430
in which you can ask and answer.
50

50

00:02:00,430  -->  00:02:03,150
And I'm really serious about the answering part.
51

51

00:02:03,150  -->  00:02:06,320
Asking is simple. Answering is hard,
52

52

00:02:06,320  -->  00:02:09,290
but ultimately you will learn a lot more,
53

53

00:02:09,290  -->  00:02:11,340
if you help your fellow students,
54

54

00:02:11,340  -->  00:02:14,090
and you also answer in the Q and A section.
55

55

00:02:14,090  -->  00:02:15,860
Of course, I'm also there to help you,
56

56

00:02:15,860  -->  00:02:18,610
and I'll do my very best to provide quick answers,
57

57

00:02:18,610  -->  00:02:20,570
on course related questions.
58

58

00:02:20,570  -->  00:02:23,310
But definitely use this as a forum for discussion.
59

59

00:02:23,310  -->  00:02:26,630
In addition, if you are facing errors,
60

60

00:02:26,630  -->  00:02:28,900
if you got an error in your code,
61

61

00:02:28,900  -->  00:02:31,050
which I don't get in the videos,
62

62

00:02:31,050  -->  00:02:32,610
if you're facing an error,
63

63

00:02:32,610  -->  00:02:35,050
compare your code to mine.
64

64

00:02:35,050  -->  00:02:38,485
You'll find snapshots, code snapshots attached by me,
65

65

00:02:38,485  -->  00:02:42,140
on the last lecture of every course module,
66

66

00:02:42,140  -->  00:02:43,900
of every course section.
67

67

00:02:43,900  -->  00:02:46,120
On the last lecture of every section,
68

68

00:02:46,120  -->  00:02:49,770
you'll find code snapshots for the different lectures,
69

69

00:02:49,770  -->  00:02:51,470
in that section.
70

70

00:02:51,470  -->  00:02:52,950
And the attachment name,
71

71

00:02:52,950  -->  00:02:55,450
will tell you to which lecture it belongs.
72

72

00:02:55,450  -->  00:03:00,450
And you can use these snapshots to compare my code to yours.
73

73

00:03:01,140  -->  00:03:04,680
You can also replace your code with mine temporarily,
74

74

00:03:04,680  -->  00:03:07,520
step by step, to narrow down the issue,
75

75

00:03:07,520  -->  00:03:10,150
and find out where your code differs,
76

76

00:03:10,150  -->  00:03:12,480
and what might be causing an error.
77

77

00:03:12,480  -->  00:03:14,550
And with that, you got all the tools you need,
78

78

00:03:14,550  -->  00:03:16,270
to get a lot out of this course.
79

79

00:03:16,270  -->  00:03:18,490
So let's jump right into the next section,
80

80

00:03:18,490  -->  00:03:21,373
where we will start with the basics of Vue.
