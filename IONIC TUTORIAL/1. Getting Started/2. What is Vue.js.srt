00:00:02,430  -->  00:00:05,630
<v Instructor>So what is Vue.js</v>
2

2

00:00:05,630  -->  00:00:09,130
or just vue as it's also called.
3

3

00:00:09,130  -->  00:00:11,620
Vue.js is a JavaScript framework
4

4

00:00:11,620  -->  00:00:13,370
that makes building interactive
5

5

00:00:13,370  -->  00:00:15,660
and reactive web frontends,
6

6

00:00:15,660  -->  00:00:17,760
which are basically web applications
7

7

00:00:17,760  -->  00:00:19,010
that run in the browser,
8

8

00:00:19,010  -->  00:00:22,320
so in the end what the user sees, easier.
9

9

00:00:22,320  -->  00:00:24,350
This is a nice sentence
10

10

00:00:24,350  -->  00:00:26,690
and it would be a correct definition,
11

11

00:00:26,690  -->  00:00:29,590
but it might not be too helpful,
12

12

00:00:29,590  -->  00:00:31,480
so let me make this a bit clearer
13

13

00:00:31,480  -->  00:00:34,100
and let's highlight the important parts here.
14

14

00:00:34,100  -->  00:00:37,720
And of course, one important part is JavaScript,
15

15

00:00:37,720  -->  00:00:42,420
Vue.js is for JavaScript and it uses JavaScript,
16

16

00:00:42,420  -->  00:00:44,210
it's all about JavaScript
17

17

00:00:44,210  -->  00:00:47,330
because JavaScript is the programming language
18

18

00:00:47,330  -->  00:00:49,610
which we can use in the browser.
19

19

00:00:49,610  -->  00:00:51,470
We can run it in the browser
20

20

00:00:51,470  -->  00:00:54,160
after a page was loaded by the user.
21

21

00:00:54,160  -->  00:00:58,630
It allows us to manipulate what the user sees on the screen
22

22

00:00:58,630  -->  00:01:01,720
without fetching a new page from the server
23

23

00:01:01,720  -->  00:01:05,360
and that allows us to provide rich user experiences
24

24

00:01:05,360  -->  00:01:06,730
and I'll come back to this
25

25

00:01:06,730  -->  00:01:10,270
rich user experiences point in just a second.
26

26

00:01:10,270  -->  00:01:12,270
But it's not just for JavaScript,
27

27

00:01:12,270  -->  00:01:15,800
indeed Vue.js is a JavaScript framework,
28

28

00:01:15,800  -->  00:01:18,180
now what does framework mean?
29

29

00:01:18,180  -->  00:01:21,210
A framework, not just in JavaScript,
30

30

00:01:21,210  -->  00:01:23,260
but in any programming language
31

31

00:01:23,260  -->  00:01:25,630
is basically a third party library
32

32

00:01:25,630  -->  00:01:28,010
which means it's code not written by you,
33

33

00:01:28,010  -->  00:01:29,660
but by someone else
34

34

00:01:29,660  -->  00:01:32,960
which exposes certain utility functionalities,
35

35

00:01:32,960  -->  00:01:35,160
certain methods, certain tools,
36

36

00:01:35,160  -->  00:01:37,200
which you don't have to write on your own
37

37

00:01:37,200  -->  00:01:41,510
and that's important, unlike a regular library,
38

38

00:01:41,510  -->  00:01:43,010
a framework is a library
39

39

00:01:43,010  -->  00:01:46,680
that does not just give you those extra functionalities,
40

40

00:01:46,680  -->  00:01:50,490
but which also gives you a set of rules you could say.
41

41

00:01:50,490  -->  00:01:52,530
It gives you a clear guidance,
42

42

00:01:52,530  -->  00:01:55,530
a clear approach that you should follow
43

43

00:01:55,530  -->  00:01:57,920
when it comes to building your application,
44

44

00:01:57,920  -->  00:02:00,330
it basically gives you a clear idea
45

45

00:02:00,330  -->  00:02:03,570
and structure of how to write your application code,
46

46

00:02:03,570  -->  00:02:07,370
so it's the utility functions plus the rules.
47

47

00:02:07,370  -->  00:02:09,040
Now, why would we use Vue.js?
48

48

00:02:09,040  -->  00:02:10,980
We also have that in a sentence
49

49

00:02:10,980  -->  00:02:13,240
because with it we can build interactive
50

50

00:02:13,240  -->  00:02:16,250
and reactive web frontends.
51

51

00:02:16,250  -->  00:02:18,130
Reactive is a pretty fancy term,
52

52

00:02:18,130  -->  00:02:20,450
but in the end what it means is that
53

53

00:02:20,450  -->  00:02:24,840
our app should be very responsive to what the user does.
54

54

00:02:24,840  -->  00:02:27,330
If a user enters something on the screen,
55

55

00:02:27,330  -->  00:02:29,430
we want to be able to react to that,
56

56

00:02:29,430  -->  00:02:33,710
for example, to show validation errors below a input field,
57

57

00:02:33,710  -->  00:02:37,000
we want to be able to show overlays with warning messages,
58

58

00:02:37,000  -->  00:02:40,800
we wanna give a user a very modern look
59

59

00:02:40,800  -->  00:02:43,710
and feel in our web application.
60

60

00:02:43,710  -->  00:02:47,690
Often we try to achieve what we know from mobile apps
61

61

00:02:47,690  -->  00:02:50,090
and I'll come back to that as well.
62

62

00:02:50,090  -->  00:02:53,340
So we wanna provide a great user experience in the end
63

63

00:02:53,340  -->  00:02:57,430
and Vue.js makes it easier for us to achieve that
64

64

00:02:57,430  -->  00:03:00,540
and the web frontends part is all the important.
65

65

00:03:00,540  -->  00:03:04,240
This basically means that Vue.js is involved with
66

66

00:03:04,240  -->  00:03:06,170
what the user sees,
67

67

00:03:06,170  -->  00:03:08,260
it's not a server side framework,
68

68

00:03:08,260  -->  00:03:11,610
we don't use it with PHP or with node,
69

69

00:03:11,610  -->  00:03:13,225
well, we can use it with all of that,
70

70

00:03:13,225  -->  00:03:15,730
but simply in a combination,
71

71

00:03:15,730  -->  00:03:20,080
but it doesn't help us write better PHP or node.js code
72

72

00:03:20,080  -->  00:03:24,110
because vue.js is for the browser side JavaScript.
73

73

00:03:24,110  -->  00:03:26,900
With HTML, CSS and JavaScript
74

74

00:03:26,900  -->  00:03:29,490
and possibly Vue.js in the browser,
75

75

00:03:29,490  -->  00:03:31,600
we can control what the user sees
76

76

00:03:31,600  -->  00:03:36,210
and we can provide rich user interface in the web.
77

77

00:03:36,210  -->  00:03:37,920
And Vue.js is a framework
78

78

00:03:37,920  -->  00:03:40,310
that helps us with building such a JavaScript
79

79

00:03:40,310  -->  00:03:43,640
driven user interface running in the browser
80

80

00:03:43,640  -->  00:03:47,430
for our web application that might be talking to a server,
81

81

00:03:47,430  -->  00:03:49,920
but it's all about the browser side code
82

82

00:03:49,920  -->  00:03:51,513
that helps us achieve that.
83

83

00:03:53,270  -->  00:03:55,790
Now why would we use something like Vue.js?
84

84

00:03:55,790  -->  00:03:59,640
Why would we want this reactive web frontend?
85

85

00:03:59,640  -->  00:04:01,370
Well, let's take a step back
86

86

00:04:01,370  -->  00:04:04,060
and let's not think about web applications,
87

87

00:04:04,060  -->  00:04:07,270
let's think about mobile applications.
88

88

00:04:07,270  -->  00:04:11,160
Mobile applications are very responsive,
89

89

00:04:11,160  -->  00:04:12,910
things happen instantly,
90

90

00:04:12,910  -->  00:04:15,410
we basically have like one screen
91

91

00:04:15,410  -->  00:04:16,860
where we add overlays,
92

92

00:04:16,860  -->  00:04:18,280
where we render lists,
93

93

00:04:18,280  -->  00:04:20,390
we can navigate to different screens
94

94

00:04:20,390  -->  00:04:22,200
with a smooth animation,
95

95

00:04:22,200  -->  00:04:26,270
it all feels like one unit you could say.
96

96

00:04:26,270  -->  00:04:30,470
So mobile apps and also desktop apps feel very reactive,
97

97

00:04:30,470  -->  00:04:33,420
we don't have to wait for new pages to load,
98

98

00:04:33,420  -->  00:04:36,300
we don't have to wait for HTML to be downloaded
99

99

00:04:36,300  -->  00:04:38,020
and rendered by the browser,
100

100

00:04:38,020  -->  00:04:41,320
instead, the entire user interface is already there,
101

101

00:04:41,320  -->  00:04:44,490
the entire user interface is part of the mobile app
102

102

00:04:44,490  -->  00:04:45,630
the user installed
103

103

00:04:45,630  -->  00:04:48,910
and the only thing that might be loaded behind the scenes
104

104

00:04:48,910  -->  00:04:50,370
is data.
105

105

00:04:50,370  -->  00:04:52,610
Now in web apps, traditionally,
106

106

00:04:52,610  -->  00:04:55,980
we click a link and we wait for a new page to load
107

107

00:04:55,980  -->  00:04:58,230
and that happens over and over again.
108

108

00:04:58,230  -->  00:05:00,280
We might enter some data in a form,
109

109

00:05:00,280  -->  00:05:01,410
we click a button,
110

110

00:05:01,410  -->  00:05:03,710
that data is submitted and as a response,
111

111

00:05:03,710  -->  00:05:05,840
we get a new HTML page.
112

112

00:05:05,840  -->  00:05:08,240
So in a traditional web page,
113

113

00:05:08,240  -->  00:05:11,163
we wait for responses all the time.
114

114

00:05:12,020  -->  00:05:14,180
JavaScript can help us here,
115

115

00:05:14,180  -->  00:05:16,460
JavaScript can speed this up
116

116

00:05:16,460  -->  00:05:18,580
and JavaScript in the browser
117

117

00:05:18,580  -->  00:05:21,840
allows us to provide a more modern web application,
118

118

00:05:21,840  -->  00:05:24,350
a more modern user interface.
119

119

00:05:24,350  -->  00:05:27,670
JavaScript has the huge advantage of running in the browser
120

120

00:05:27,670  -->  00:05:29,360
on the loaded page,
121

121

00:05:29,360  -->  00:05:32,370
that means we have a language running in the browser,
122

122

00:05:32,370  -->  00:05:35,480
which can be used to change that page
123

123

00:05:35,480  -->  00:05:38,920
without fetching new HTML behind the scenes.
124

124

00:05:38,920  -->  00:05:42,260
Instead, we can manipulate the HTML structure,
125

125

00:05:42,260  -->  00:05:45,620
the so-called DOM, Document Object Model
126

126

00:05:45,620  -->  00:05:48,040
of a page with JavaScript.
127

127

00:05:48,040  -->  00:05:49,790
And that means that in modern
128

128

00:05:49,790  -->  00:05:52,460
JavaScript driven web applications,
129

129

00:05:52,460  -->  00:05:56,290
we're not sending a request to get a new HTML page,
130

130

00:05:56,290  -->  00:05:59,040
instead, we only do this once
131

131

00:05:59,040  -->  00:06:02,800
and thereafter, we just exchange data behind the scenes
132

132

00:06:02,800  -->  00:06:05,410
and we use client side JavaScript
133

133

00:06:05,410  -->  00:06:07,700
and possibly frameworks like Vue
134

134

00:06:07,700  -->  00:06:10,710
to update what's on the screen.
135

135

00:06:10,710  -->  00:06:13,930
And we're using solutions like Vue.js
136

136

00:06:13,930  -->  00:06:18,190
because just JavaScript may not be ideal.
137

137

00:06:18,190  -->  00:06:21,320
Theoretically, we can build any kind of web application
138

138

00:06:21,320  -->  00:06:23,910
with just vanilla JavaScript,
139

139

00:06:23,910  -->  00:06:28,060
so with just JavaScript without any extra frameworks
140

140

00:06:28,060  -->  00:06:29,580
or libraries.
141

141

00:06:29,580  -->  00:06:32,660
No framework like Vue is needed in reality,
142

142

00:06:32,660  -->  00:06:36,860
but it wouldn't be much fun to use just JavaScript
143

143

00:06:36,860  -->  00:06:39,090
because we have to write all the code,
144

144

00:06:39,090  -->  00:06:41,140
all the logic on our own,
145

145

00:06:41,140  -->  00:06:45,060
we have to reinvent the wheel over and over again.
146

146

00:06:45,060  -->  00:06:47,500
We might even write sub optimal code
147

147

00:06:47,500  -->  00:06:49,680
and introduce errors and bugs
148

148

00:06:49,680  -->  00:06:52,050
because we have to write everything from scratch
149

149

00:06:52,050  -->  00:06:54,450
and we have to do these things correctly,
150

150

00:06:54,450  -->  00:06:59,050
otherwise we might have poor performance or security issues.
151

151

00:06:59,050  -->  00:07:01,410
Working in a team might also be harder
152

152

00:07:01,410  -->  00:07:04,150
because not everyone knows our code structure,
153

153

00:07:04,150  -->  00:07:05,970
the philosophy behind our code
154

154

00:07:05,970  -->  00:07:07,800
and how to use our code.
155

155

00:07:07,800  -->  00:07:10,230
And that's why we use something like Vue,
156

156

00:07:10,230  -->  00:07:12,840
it gives us a clear rule set
157

157

00:07:12,840  -->  00:07:14,300
in which we have to work,

158

00:07:14,300  -->  00:07:16,930
which everyone in a team has to use
159

159

00:07:16,930  -->  00:07:18,450
and we don't have to figure out
160

160

00:07:18,450  -->  00:07:21,120
all the small nitty gritty details
161

161

00:07:21,120  -->  00:07:23,900
like updating a part on the page,
162

162

00:07:23,900  -->  00:07:28,490
instead, we can focus on our core business logic with Vue
163

163

00:07:28,490  -->  00:07:32,380
and let Vue do the heavy lifting of updating the page
164

164

00:07:32,380  -->  00:07:34,270
and of doing all the annoying stuff
165

165

00:07:34,270  -->  00:07:36,320
which we would have to do otherwise.
166

166

00:07:36,320  -->  00:07:38,400
That's why we use frameworks like Vue
167

167

00:07:38,400  -->  00:07:40,750
and for the course, this will become obvious
168

168

00:07:40,750  -->  00:07:43,970
once we dive into all the features Vue offers
169

169

00:07:43,970  -->  00:07:46,170
and how easy those features make it
170

170

00:07:46,170  -->  00:07:49,773
to build amazing web applications and user interfaces.
