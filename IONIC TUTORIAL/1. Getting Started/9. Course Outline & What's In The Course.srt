00:00:02,120  -->  00:00:04,460
<v Instructor>So what is in this course then,</v>
2

2

00:00:04,460  -->  00:00:06,990
what does this course have to offer?
3

3

00:00:06,990  -->  00:00:10,770
Well, a lot, this is a huge course.
4

4

00:00:10,770  -->  00:00:14,350
I completely updated it with the release of view free
5

5

00:00:14,350  -->  00:00:15,830
and I'll keep updating it
6

6

00:00:15,830  -->  00:00:18,260
and it has tons of content.
7

7

00:00:18,260  -->  00:00:21,010
We'll take a deep dive into view
8

8

00:00:21,010  -->  00:00:23,920
and we'll start at the absolute basics.
9

9

00:00:23,920  -->  00:00:27,440
No prior view knowledge is required for this course,
10

10

00:00:27,440  -->  00:00:30,490
and we will walk through all these important basics,
11

11

00:00:30,490  -->  00:00:32,180
step by step.
12

12

00:00:32,180  -->  00:00:35,360
We will have modules, course sections
13

13

00:00:35,360  -->  00:00:39,090
where we explore the base syntax, templates,
14

14

00:00:39,090  -->  00:00:42,520
directives, working with data and methods,
15

15

00:00:42,520  -->  00:00:44,970
computed properties and Watchers,
16

16

00:00:44,970  -->  00:00:47,700
and you will learn what all these things are
17

17

00:00:47,700  -->  00:00:50,540
and how to use them and how they work together
18

18

00:00:50,540  -->  00:00:54,210
and this will give us the foundation so to say.
19

19

00:00:54,210  -->  00:00:58,040
Now we'll also thereafter explore intermediate concepts,
20

20

00:00:58,040  -->  00:00:59,856
we're going to explore components
21

21

00:00:59,856  -->  00:01:02,410
and component communication.
22

22

00:01:02,410  -->  00:01:05,080
We'll take a look behind the scenes of view
23

23

00:01:05,080  -->  00:01:07,230
to see how it works under the hood
24

24

00:01:07,230  -->  00:01:10,200
and to understand its magic.
25

25

00:01:10,200  -->  00:01:14,090
We'll learn how to work with forums and user input,
26

26

00:01:14,090  -->  00:01:16,280
sending http requests,
27

27

00:01:16,280  -->  00:01:17,800
how to implement routing
28

28

00:01:17,800  -->  00:01:20,130
and load different pages in a view app
29

29

00:01:20,130  -->  00:01:21,910
even if it's a single page app,
30

30

00:01:21,910  -->  00:01:24,880
yes, that sounds strange, but it will work.
31

31

00:01:24,880  -->  00:01:27,590
We'll dive into animations with you
32

32

00:01:27,590  -->  00:01:29,500
and we're not even done thereafter,
33

33

00:01:29,500  -->  00:01:32,340
we'll also explore advanced concepts,
34

34

00:01:32,340  -->  00:01:36,530
we will dive into working with Vuex for state management.
35

35

00:01:36,530  -->  00:01:39,180
We'll explore authentication in view apps,
36

36

00:01:39,180  -->  00:01:41,970
how to deploy and optimize your view app.
37

37

00:01:41,970  -->  00:01:44,650
We'll have a look at the composition API,
38

38

00:01:44,650  -->  00:01:46,890
which was introduced with view free
39

39

00:01:46,890  -->  00:01:48,480
and when I say a look,
40

40

00:01:48,480  -->  00:01:50,690
I mean a huge module
41

41

00:01:50,690  -->  00:01:53,210
where we dive super deeply into it.
42

42

00:01:53,210  -->  00:01:55,430
We will learn how we may reuse code
43

43

00:01:55,430  -->  00:01:57,720
with and without the composition API
44

44

00:01:57,720  -->  00:02:00,360
and that's really not even all,
45

45

00:02:00,360  -->  00:02:03,070
there is so much content in this course.
46

46

00:02:03,070  -->  00:02:06,820
But we'll not just walk through all these topics and theory,
47

47

00:02:06,820  -->  00:02:10,240
instead, I prepared dozens of small demos
48

48

00:02:10,240  -->  00:02:12,040
and mini projects for you,
49

49

00:02:12,040  -->  00:02:13,980
which we use in the different modules
50

50

00:02:13,980  -->  00:02:16,960
to learn about different concepts.
51

51

00:02:16,960  -->  00:02:20,370
And we also got multiple bigger course projects
52

52

00:02:20,370  -->  00:02:23,150
where we will start from scratch together
53

53

00:02:23,150  -->  00:02:25,135
and implement all those features
54

54

00:02:25,135  -->  00:02:27,930
in the context of bigger demos,
55

55

00:02:27,930  -->  00:02:30,260
in the context of bigger projects
56

56

00:02:30,260  -->  00:02:32,220
which are then of course, for example,
57

57

00:02:32,220  -->  00:02:34,363
could also add to your portfolio.
58

58

00:02:35,390  -->  00:02:37,470
In addition, you'll find assignments
59

59

00:02:37,470  -->  00:02:39,390
and challenges in this course,
60

60

00:02:39,390  -->  00:02:42,570
with challenges I mean that I will sometimes tell you
61

61

00:02:42,570  -->  00:02:45,470
to pause a video and try something on your own and
62

62

00:02:45,470  -->  00:02:48,180
you can then do that to practice this on your own
63

63

00:02:48,180  -->  00:02:50,370
and overall you will get all the theory
64

64

00:02:50,370  -->  00:02:53,490
and all the practice you need with this course,
65

65

00:02:53,490  -->  00:02:55,963
it's a huge course with tons of content.
