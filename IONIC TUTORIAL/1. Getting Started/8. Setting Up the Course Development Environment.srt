00:00:02,130  -->  00:00:04,470
<v Instructor>So now that we had a first look at Vue,</v>
2

2

00:00:04,470  -->  00:00:07,990
let me quickly walk through what you'll find in this course,
3

3

00:00:07,990  -->  00:00:10,950
to give you an overview of all the content in this course
4

4

00:00:10,950  -->  00:00:13,480
and then we'll dive deeper into Vue.
5

5

00:00:13,480  -->  00:00:14,790
Now in this lecture,
6

6

00:00:14,790  -->  00:00:18,710
I want to talk about the development setup I'll be using.
7

7

00:00:18,710  -->  00:00:22,060
I already mentioned that I work with Visual Studio Code,
8

8

00:00:22,060  -->  00:00:23,100
which is this editor,
9

9

00:00:23,100  -->  00:00:24,994
which I would recommend that you also use.
10

10

00:00:24,994  -->  00:00:26,230
And in there,
11

11

00:00:26,230  -->  00:00:29,583
I showed you that I used the dark plus color theme.
12

12

00:00:31,020  -->  00:00:34,040
Now I'm not using any other special settings here,
13

13

00:00:34,040  -->  00:00:35,380
which you should know,
14

14

00:00:35,380  -->  00:00:38,341
but I will use one shortcut from time to time,
15

15

00:00:38,341  -->  00:00:40,008
which is really handy.
16

16

00:00:40,008  -->  00:00:44,950
So under preferences, keyboard shortcuts,
17

17

00:00:44,950  -->  00:00:47,940
you can search for format document.
18

18

00:00:47,940  -->  00:00:50,020
And this shortcut,
19

19

00:00:50,020  -->  00:00:52,990
which you can bind in case you don't have it yet,
20

20

00:00:52,990  -->  00:00:54,930
will automatically format the code
21

21

00:00:54,930  -->  00:00:56,650
to make it a bit more readable.
22

22

00:00:56,650  -->  00:00:59,010
For example, if that would be indented,
23

23

00:00:59,010  -->  00:01:03,070
it would work technically, but it would be a bit strange.
24

24

00:01:03,070  -->  00:01:06,680
It would look strange, it would be a bit hard to read.
25

25

00:01:06,680  -->  00:01:09,950
With that shortcut, it will be reformatted.
26

26

00:01:09,950  -->  00:01:12,180
And in case that's not working for you,
27

27

00:01:12,180  -->  00:01:15,590
you can also go to View, Extensions,
28

28

00:01:15,590  -->  00:01:18,410
to browse the extensions marketplace
29

29

00:01:18,410  -->  00:01:21,510
and search for Prettier there.
30

30

00:01:21,510  -->  00:01:23,050
And make sure you install
31

31

00:01:23,050  -->  00:01:26,500
the Prettier Code Formatting Extension.
32

32

00:01:26,500  -->  00:01:28,770
If you do that, once you install it,
33

33

00:01:28,770  -->  00:01:33,660
if you reload, that format shortcut should work for you.
34

34

00:01:33,660  -->  00:01:37,570
You can ensure that Prettier is getting used for formatting
35

35

00:01:37,570  -->  00:01:41,170
by going to preferences settings,
36

36

00:01:41,170  -->  00:01:43,790
and then there search for format.
37

37

00:01:43,790  -->  00:01:46,800
And under Editor, Default Formatter,
38

38

00:01:46,800  -->  00:01:50,753
make sure prettier-vscode is selected.
39

39

00:01:51,700  -->  00:01:53,699
That's one setting I would recommend that you use
40

40

00:01:53,699  -->  00:01:55,950
to have more readable code.
41

41

00:01:55,950  -->  00:01:58,800
And that said, this is the setup I will work with,
42

42

00:01:58,800  -->  00:02:01,440
and this is the editor You will see me using
43

43

00:02:01,440  -->  00:02:02,590
throughout this course.
