00:00:02,360  -->  00:00:04,220
<v ->Now there is certainly a lot of magic</v>
2

2

00:00:04,220  -->  00:00:05,630
in there at the moment.
3

3

00:00:05,630  -->  00:00:08,680
But the key thing is that with Vue,
4

4

00:00:08,680  -->  00:00:10,870
we just find the end result,
5

5

00:00:10,870  -->  00:00:15,130
and we use these special features in the HTML code
6

6

00:00:15,130  -->  00:00:20,130
to connect HTML to data and logic managed in the Vue app.
7

7

00:00:21,230  -->  00:00:22,700
And we will learn about a lot
8

8

00:00:22,700  -->  00:00:25,200
of features Vue has to offer to us
9

9

00:00:25,200  -->  00:00:27,990
which allows to build any kind of app.
10

10

00:00:27,990  -->  00:00:29,600
And being able to do this
11

11

00:00:29,600  -->  00:00:32,880
and follow this declarative approach
12

12

00:00:32,880  -->  00:00:35,400
where we declared the result instead
13

13

00:00:35,400  -->  00:00:37,160
of the steps of getting there,
14

14

00:00:37,160  -->  00:00:40,520
that allows us to build super large applications
15

15

00:00:40,520  -->  00:00:42,680
without any issues.
16

16

00:00:42,680  -->  00:00:44,920
Whereas just JavaScript,
17

17

00:00:44,920  -->  00:00:47,190
if we would have a more complex app,
18

18

00:00:47,190  -->  00:00:49,910
would quickly run into problems.
19

19

00:00:49,910  -->  00:00:53,180
We would quickly face issues there in bigger apps
20

20

00:00:53,180  -->  00:00:55,200
if we would use just JavaScript,
21

21

00:00:55,200  -->  00:00:58,570
and writing an application that's error free
22

22

00:00:58,570  -->  00:01:01,800
and offers great performance would be difficult
23

23

00:01:01,800  -->  00:01:03,690
with just JavaScript.
24

24

00:01:03,690  -->  00:01:05,910
With Vue, it'll be easy.
25

25

00:01:05,910  -->  00:01:08,710
And in this course, you're going to learn all about Vue.
