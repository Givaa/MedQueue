00:00:02,160  -->  00:00:04,900
<v Schwarzmüller>So, in order to get our hands dirty,</v>
2

2

00:00:04,900  -->  00:00:08,890
I prepared a very simple dummy project for you,
3

3

00:00:08,890  -->  00:00:11,280
You'll find it attached to this lecture
4

4

00:00:11,280  -->  00:00:15,210
as a zip file which you can download and extract,
5

5

00:00:15,210  -->  00:00:16,900
and in that extracted folder,
6

6

00:00:16,900  -->  00:00:20,980
you will find three files, an app.js file,
7

7

00:00:20,980  -->  00:00:24,773
an index.html file and a styles.css file.
8

8

00:00:25,750  -->  00:00:28,730
Now, here, I opened this extracted folder
9

9

00:00:28,730  -->  00:00:31,794
with Visual Studio Code, the code editor I'm
10

10

00:00:31,794  -->  00:00:34,440
going to use throughout this course.
11

11

00:00:34,440  -->  00:00:38,752
Now, you can use any code editor or IDE of your choice.
12

12

00:00:38,752  -->  00:00:41,060
You don't need a specific tool,
13

13

00:00:41,060  -->  00:00:43,780
but, I strongly recommend Visual Studio Code,
14

14

00:00:43,780  -->  00:00:48,370
which you can get for free from code.visualstudio.com.
15

15

00:00:48,370  -->  00:00:51,440
It's available for macOS, Windows and Linux,
16

16

00:00:51,440  -->  00:00:53,640
so you can use it on any platform,
17

17

00:00:53,640  -->  00:00:58,620
and you can simply download and install it from that page.
18

18

00:00:58,620  -->  00:01:01,950
And, once you did that, you can open the attached extracted
19

19

00:01:01,950  -->  00:01:06,950
folder with File, Open and then navigate to that folder
20

20

00:01:07,650  -->  00:01:09,090
and open it.
21

21

00:01:09,090  -->  00:01:11,700
You can close the welcome screen you might see
22

22

00:01:11,700  -->  00:01:14,730
in Visual Studio Code, and if you want to get the exact same
23

23

00:01:14,730  -->  00:01:19,540
look as I do, under View, Appearance, you can control which
24

24

00:01:19,540  -->  00:01:23,460
sidebars are visible or not visible, and I only have the
25

25

00:01:23,460  -->  00:01:26,160
sidebar and the editor area open.
26

26

00:01:26,160  -->  00:01:29,040
I, for example, don't have the activity bar,
27

27

00:01:29,040  -->  00:01:30,880
which you might still have.
28

28

00:01:30,880  -->  00:01:35,880
I am also zoomed in here, and under Code, Preferences,
29

29

00:01:36,136  -->  00:01:41,136
Color theme, I am using the Dark+ theme.
30

30

00:01:41,170  -->  00:01:43,257
Now, you can configure this however you want,
31

31

00:01:43,257  -->  00:01:46,860
but that is the style I am using.
32

32

00:01:46,860  -->  00:01:50,120
Now, with that, let's start writing some code
33

33

00:01:50,120  -->  00:01:52,200
and I will actually start
34

34

00:01:52,200  -->  00:01:55,900
by writing some non-view code first,
35

35

00:01:55,900  -->  00:01:58,079
so that we thereafter can see
36

36

00:01:58,079  -->  00:02:02,683
why using a framework like Vue.js might be a good idea.
37

37

00:02:03,660  -->  00:02:06,070 line:15% 
On this demo project which I prepared,
38

38

00:02:06,070  -->  00:02:07,860 line:15% 
we can add Goals,
39

39

00:02:07,860  -->  00:02:10,120 line:15% 
we've got a test goal at the moment,
40

40

00:02:10,120  -->  00:02:12,216 line:15% 
and we will delete that soon,
41

41

00:02:12,216  -->  00:02:15,010
but, now, whenever I add a new goal here,
42

42

00:02:15,010  -->  00:02:16,864
like 'Finish the course'
43

43

00:02:16,864  -->  00:02:20,380
I want to make sure when at 'Add Goal' is clicked,
44

44

00:02:20,380  -->  00:02:23,835
this goal appears in that list down there.
45

45

00:02:23,835  -->  00:02:26,730
In the index.html file, we've got some
46

46

00:02:26,730  -->  00:02:30,420
mark up for that input field label button,
47

47

00:02:30,420  -->  00:02:33,260
and then that list with the dummy list item,
48

48

00:02:33,260  -->  00:02:35,100
which we can delete now.
49

49

00:02:35,100  -->  00:02:38,250
And, I'm importing some styles which I prepared for you,
50

50

00:02:38,250  -->  00:02:39,946
we don't have to care about those,
51

51

00:02:39,946  -->  00:02:42,860
it's not a CSS course after all,
52

52

00:02:42,860  -->  00:02:45,330
but we do all the import app.js,
53

53

00:02:45,330  -->  00:02:47,950
and here we can write some some JavaScript code
54

54

00:02:47,950  -->  00:02:51,270
to fetch the user input when the button is clicked,
55

55

00:02:51,270  -->  00:02:52,890
create a new list item,
56

56

00:02:52,890  -->  00:02:56,640
and add that to that list of list items here.
57

57

00:02:56,640  -->  00:02:58,795
And, that's what I want to do first now,
58

58

00:02:58,795  -->  00:03:02,870
with just JavaScript, so without Vue.
59

59

00:03:02,870  -->  00:03:04,550
In app.js for that,
60

60

00:03:04,550  -->  00:03:08,210
we first of all need to get access to the input,
61

61

00:03:08,210  -->  00:03:11,570
so that we can read the entered value,
62

62

00:03:11,570  -->  00:03:13,530
we need to get access to the button,
63

63

00:03:13,530  -->  00:03:17,198
so that we can listen to click events on the button,
64

64

00:03:17,198  -->  00:03:20,530
and we need to get access to the unordered list here,
65

65

00:03:20,530  -->  00:03:23,160
so that we can add new list items.
66

66

00:03:23,160  -->  00:03:25,490
Therefore, I will create three constants here
67

67

00:03:25,490  -->  00:03:26,630
in app.js.
68

68

00:03:26,630  -->  00:03:29,872
The first one is the buttonEl constant, lets say,
69

69

00:03:29,872  -->  00:03:32,310
this name, of course, is up to you,
70

70

00:03:32,310  -->  00:03:34,600
where I use document.querySelector
71

71

00:03:35,448  -->  00:03:38,974
to select the only button we have on this page.
72

72

00:03:38,974  -->  00:03:43,974
So, now, pointer to that dom element, to that JavaScript
73

73

00:03:44,670  -->  00:03:48,300
object representation of that button element,
74

74

00:03:48,300  -->  00:03:51,003
Is stored in that buttonEl const.
75

75

00:03:52,200  -->  00:03:53,930
I'll do the same for the input element,
76

76

00:03:53,930  -->  00:03:57,520
with document.querySelector ('input')
77

77

00:03:59,020  -->  00:04:04,020
and also for the listEl with document.querySelector ('ul')
78

78

00:04:06,350  -->  00:04:07,563
for unread list.
79

79

00:04:09,400  -->  00:04:13,540
Now, we can add a click Lister with JavaScript
80

80

00:04:13,540  -->  00:04:15,310
to this button by reaching out to the
81

81

00:04:15,310  -->  00:04:19,290
buttonEl and calling addEventListener,
82

82

00:04:19,290  -->  00:04:22,920
where we then listen to the click event like this
83

83

00:04:22,920  -->  00:04:25,080
by passing click as a string,
84

84

00:04:25,080  -->  00:04:26,603
as a first argument.
85

85

00:04:27,600  -->  00:04:29,900
The second argument now needs to be the
86

86

00:04:29,900  -->  00:04:34,270
function that should be executed when the click occurs,
87

87

00:04:34,270  -->  00:04:37,564
For that, we can define a new function here,
88

88

00:04:37,564  -->  00:04:40,543
addGoal could be the name,
89

89

00:04:41,430  -->  00:04:43,607
which should be triggered upon a click,
90

90

00:04:43,607  -->  00:04:47,140
so here we can then point at addGoal.
91

91

00:04:48,220  -->  00:04:51,550
We don't execute it here, we just point at it
92

92

00:04:51,550  -->  00:04:53,990
by repeating its name, so that the function
93

93

00:04:53,990  -->  00:04:57,590
is executed for us when a click occurs,
94

94

00:04:57,590  -->  00:04:59,710
Now, in this function we want to get
95

95

00:04:59,710  -->  00:05:01,670
whatever the user entered.
96

96

00:05:01,670  -->  00:05:04,640
So, we can get the entered value by
97

97

00:05:04,640  -->  00:05:09,640
reaching out to inputEl.value, being an input element,
98

98

00:05:09,970  -->  00:05:13,183
at which were pointing here, it will have a value property
99

99

00:05:13,183  -->  00:05:17,120
that's vanilla JavaScript, that's built into JavaScript
100

100

00:05:17,120  -->  00:05:20,560
that we have this value property on input elements,
101

101

00:05:20,560  -->  00:05:23,975
where we then can extract the value the user entered
102

102

00:05:23,975  -->  00:05:25,323
into this input.
103

103

00:05:26,670  -->  00:05:31,670
And now, we can create a new list item element by calling
104

104

00:05:34,090  -->  00:05:39,090
document.createElement which is a built-in method provided
105

105

00:05:39,420  -->  00:05:43,890
by the browser, to create new dom elements programmatically
106

106

00:05:43,890  -->  00:05:45,850
with JavaScript.
107

107

00:05:45,850  -->  00:05:48,760
Here, we can provide 'li' to create a list item
108

108

00:05:48,760  -->  00:05:53,210
element, and then we can use that newly created list item
109

109

00:05:53,210  -->  00:05:57,570
element to set its text content, so the text between the
110

110

00:05:57,570  -->  00:06:01,330
opening and closing text, of that list item, equal to the
111

111

00:06:01,330  -->  00:06:02,383
entered value.
112

112

00:06:03,380  -->  00:06:06,670
And then, we can reach out to the listEl, so to
113

113

00:06:06,670  -->  00:06:11,670
our overall list, and call append or appendChild,
114

114

00:06:12,310  -->  00:06:15,773
both will work here, I'll go for appendChild,
115

115

00:06:15,773  -->  00:06:18,540
and append our list itemEl,
116

116

00:06:18,540  -->  00:06:20,610
which we just created.
117

117

00:06:20,610  -->  00:06:25,140
If we do all of that, and we reload I can add
118

118

00:06:25,140  -->  00:06:28,230
'Finish the course!' and add this goal.
119

119

00:06:28,230  -->  00:06:33,230
And thereafter, for example, also add 'Learn Vue!'
120

120

00:06:33,380  -->  00:06:34,930
as a goal.
121

121

00:06:34,930  -->  00:06:37,650
Now, let's say we also want to reset the input
122

122

00:06:37,650  -->  00:06:40,900
once a goal was added, we could do that by, again,
123

123

00:06:40,900  -->  00:06:43,830
using our inputEl and setting
124

124

00:06:43,830  -->  00:06:46,080
value equal to an empty string.
125

125

00:06:46,080  -->  00:06:49,240
This will set the value in the input element to an
126

126

00:06:49,240  -->  00:06:52,200
empty text, and therefore clears it.
127

127

00:06:52,200  -->  00:06:54,700
So, with that if we reload again,
128

128

00:06:54,700  -->  00:06:57,080
and I 'Finish the course!', now this would be
129

129

00:06:57,080  -->  00:06:58,650
cleared.
130

130

00:06:58,650  -->  00:07:02,740
Now, that's just JavaScript, no Vue in action,
131

131

00:07:02,740  -->  00:07:07,500
and it's obviously a very very very trivial demo website.
132

132

00:07:07,500  -->  00:07:10,670
Still, we will now use Vue and you'll thereafter
133

133

00:07:10,670  -->  00:07:14,810
see why Vue might be quite interesting, as it makes building
134

134

00:07:14,810  -->  00:07:16,450
websites more fun.
135

135

00:07:16,450  -->  00:07:17,860
I'll then also talk about the
136

136

00:07:17,860  -->  00:07:20,840
differences between Vue and this approach,
137

137

00:07:20,840  -->  00:07:24,433
but first of all, let's switch to Vue in the next lecture.
